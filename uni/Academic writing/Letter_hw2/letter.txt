Subject: Application for Student Exchange Programme

-----------------

Dear <Head of committee? I don't really know whom to address here>

I am writing to apply for a position in the upcoming student exchange programme this March.

Currently, I am a third-year student in the Information Technologies programme. Alongside my university studies, I have already spent two years working professionally as a C# and Python developer here in Lithuania. I am passionate for both software and hardware, and I have strong communication skills. I currently have a C1 level in English and am eager to utilize it with native speakers from a foreign country.

My primary motivation for applying is to refine my language skills beyond mostly technical vocabulary. Furthermore, I view this as a unique chance to network with international students and explore a new culture.
This experience would serve as a valuable mental refresh as well, allowing me to return to my coursework with renewed energy and a broader perspective.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely

Danila Gudim
