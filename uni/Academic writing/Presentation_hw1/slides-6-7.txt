6 And now we are going to take some advice from
2 great books written by people who know the topic well.


The book is 'Art of dealing with people' by Les Giblin

-- One: Communication builds relationships

If you think that some piece of information is worth sharing,
share it with people you want to get close to. Speak with confidence to build up trust, approach people from a direction more or less coinciding with their views. Tell them something informative, something they can relate to and find useful.

-- Two

For effecting and informative speaking you should not go around the topic or deviate too much, nobody os interested in that and people will lose attention. Instead, you should get to the point.

-- Three

This is an extension to the first point. Quoting Giblin here "People like to feel important" (in a conversation). This makes them feel more comfortable and makes communication more 2-way then 1-way. You should acknowledge the audience, tell them something they can relate to or find interest in. And thank them for their time at the end.



The second book is "Art of persuasion" by Bob Burg

-- First advice:

Win without intimidation.
You don't want to threaten people, you are just trying to convince them. You shouldn't consider only your needs, but theirs as well. You should present the benefits in a way that would fulfil their needs. But don't try to convince the too hard, If you see that the persuasion is not really working, accept your loss.

-- Second thing:

Successful persuasion relies on trust from both sides nad credibility you can provide to the other party.

You should properly introduce yourself and the thing you are going to talk about. While explaining the benefits and drawbacks, don't hide uncomfortable truths and facts, be honest. Trust the other party for them to trust you.

-- And the lat one:

This is an extension to the first one. Listen to the needs of the other party. When considering the needs of the people you are trying to persuade, put yourself in their shoes and understand what benefits the other party will gain from agreeing with you.
