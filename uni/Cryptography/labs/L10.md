The file we get is

```toml
User-agent: *
Disallow: /configz/
Allow: /
Crawl-delay: 2

Security: https://issauga.lt/security.txt
```

> [!explanation] 
> 
> - User-agent: \* - Applies to *every bot/automated tool (not a browser)*
> - Disallow: /configz/ - *Forbid* crawling anything under the */configz* path
> - Allow: / - *Allow crawling everything* from root (honoring the disallow directive/s)
>   > [!note]
>   > This is the default behavour, so it's redundant here
> - Crawl-delay: 2 - Wait a minimum of *2 seconds* before requesting a new url (This is one of the ways to throttle crawling)
>   > [!note] 
>   > This is **not honored** by most search engines including google and bing, you can limit crawling [with http code 429](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/reduce-crawl-rate)
> - Security: Link to a file with contact and security info (ignored by robots.txt parser)
