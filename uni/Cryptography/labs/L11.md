## Web page security testing

### W3C validator

> https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fissauga.lt%2F&checkerrorpages=yes

> [!note] 
> This validator checks if the html layout of the website is valid

`````col 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1
===

We got several errors

![[Pasted image 20241217194312.png]]

```` 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1
===

And some info messages

![[Pasted image 20241217194356.png]]

```` 
`````

> None of the issues affect the security, they only affect the layout, different html parsers may display the page differently, so it looks different

### Link availability checking

> [!note] 
> This scanner collects all the links from the website and checks if they point somewhere and/or work at all

#### Summary

![[Pasted image 20241217195712.png]]

- 3 links were skipped because of robbots txt standard
- 1 link returns 400
- 1 link returns 403
- 1 link returns 404

#### Issues and solutions

`````col 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1
===

> https://issauga.lt/docs/

This link returns 404

> [!info]
> because it's on the same domain and accessed via https, this has *no real security issues*, you just need to update the url to point to a valid address or remove the link completely

```` 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1

> ![[Pasted image 20241217200338.png]]

This link redirects to https version of the same website, which may or may not be a security issues

> [!info] 
> - Possible attack vector: *MITM attack*, redirecting http page to something a bad actor controls
> - Propability of success: **low**. The link goes to facebook, and it most certainly is in the [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) preload list of the browser, so unless the user is on some very old browser, the browser won't even try to load the website via *http*

This link returns 400 (Not really though, if you follow it manually, it first redirects you to another domain entirely)

> [!info]
> *Not really a security issue* either because the link is on your domain, you just need to fix your redirects

```` 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1

![[Pasted image 20241217201415.png]]

> Some other links are accesed via http and the websites may or may not be in the HSTS preload list, so there is a risk or MITM, you ned to update those links

![[Pasted image 20241217201456.png]]

> Here the browser itself blocked http request from https context, not really a security issues because of the strict content policy, but the link needs fixing

### HTTPS service evaluation

> [!note] 
> This scanner checks if the website has a valid *https certificate*, *TLS version*, certificate *issuer* and other SSL-connected things

`````col 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1
===

![[Pasted image 20241217202929.png]]

All good here!

````col-md

### Mozilla observatory

> This scanner among other things checks for content policy and different header options

We get a score or 0, LOL

#### Issues

- ![[Pasted image 20241217203824.png]] If you visit this website via **http**, it would still work, but it should redirect to **https** because **http** is plain-text and is *not secure*, there is a possibility of MITM
- ![[Pasted image 20241217204007.png]] These 2 errors are also connected with loading over **http**, same issues as in the 1st one
- ![[Pasted image 20241217204255.png]] **X-Content-Type-Options** is not really applicable to us as we are not serving any css or js files, but it's still a good idea to set it to *nosniff*
  **X-Frame-Options** is another story though, not setting it allows other websites to embed your website in an *iframe* and trick the user, if the site has any login functionality, this is a big issue
