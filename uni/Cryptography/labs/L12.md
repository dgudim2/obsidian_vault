## Vulnerability testing

### Installing nessus

> I am on linux, so this will boil down to just 2 commands
> You can follow this tutorial: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nessus

- Install package from here: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nessus (yay -S nessus)
- Start nessus systemd service: `systemctl start nessusd.service`

### Initial setup

- Your average click-through setup, provide your email, ~~sell you kidney~~ and activate the trial

### Scanning stuff

> I scanned my own machine, so nothing fancy

Start your scan from the main page -> *New scan* -> *Basic network scan* (2nd from the top on the left)

After the scan finishes, you will get a report akin to something like this:

### Interpreting the results

> [!note] 
> Because I was scanning my local machine, there were no actual vulnerabilities

The only warning I got, was about nessuses' own ssl certificate

```` 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1

> [!info] 
> Clicking on the report item, we get a description of the issue (the certificate is not *signed*, nessus complains that it cannot be trusted), some details like severity and risk info, and possible solution (generate a proper certificate)


### Features not available in the trial

I got a trial of nessus **expert**, so I only had 2 options unavailable, both connected with mobile device scanning

Nessus sells these options as a separate product for which you can get a separate trial
