# Argon 2

## What is argon 2?

> **From the docs:** _Argon2 is a secure password hashing algorithm_. It is designed to have both a configurable runtime as well as memory consumption.

### Argon 2 features

- Offline key derivation
- Configurable runtime
- Configurable memory consumption
- Effective use of multiple computing units

## Why and where to use argon 2?

> This algorithm should be used specifically used to **hash passwords**. 
> It provides better protection against password cracking than other hashing algorithms like **Bcrypt**, **Scrypt**, and **PBKDF2**.

So, if you want your passwords in the database to be securely hashed, use argon2
