## Web security

### Found security features

#### Illegal (unsafe) character filtering

> Line 11
```js
let lUnsafeCharacters = /[\W|_]/g;
```

**Intention**: protect against _XSS_ attacks or something similar
**Effectiveness**: ==Low==, because this is done completely client-side and not even using library functions and can be easily disabled

> [!note] 
> In the code, the password is also filtered for 'unsafe' characters, this is bad and hurts user experience, there *should be no filtering on the password*, if should be *immediately hashed* instead

#### Regex-based validity checking

> Line 67-68
```js
let ldate = /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/;
let lemail =
      /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,}))$/;

```

**Intention**: Disallow invalid emails and dates, this is not a security feature per say, but a sanity check.
**Effectiveness**: ==Questionable==, because those things *should not be checked with regex*, it's hard to make changes and understand such a big regex

> [!note] 
> **Always** check validity on the back-end as well, the *user can always modify client code and bypass validation*

#### Other validity checks

There are some other validity checks on the website. 
I.e: **length** checks, those are not a security feature either, but may prevent several unwanted things. For example server overload by sending huge payloads.
