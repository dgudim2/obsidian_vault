## Parallel coordinates, wine parameters

![[Pasted image 20260226193218.png]]

This plot shows correlation between wine quality and its various parameters. 
We can see that higher quality wines have higher alcohol levels and sulfur dioxide concentrations.

## Joined plot, diabetes outcome

> [!summary] 
> In this plot I plotted BMI and age in a 2d scatter-plot

<br>

> [!note] 
> - We can see that if your BMI is between 30 and 40, you are most likely to be diabetic. 
> - Age does not matter that much for positive cases
> But for negative cases, you are less likely to get diabetes while you are < 30 years old.
> - We can also see a hard cut-off at 20 years, this dataset does not include children

> In this plot I plotted Ph against alcoloh level, categorized by quality

<br>

> [!note] 
> - We can see that Ph level does not really corellate well with quality, it's normal for all the qualities, but the alcohol level does - lower quality wines are skewed towards low alcohol levels
> - We can also see a slight positive correlation between Ph and alcohol level

## **My best Vanilla Cake recipe is…..**
- **Plush, moist, fluffy crumb** without being freakishly unnaturally so (as some store bought can be). _No more dense cakes__!_
- **Keeps near perfectly for 4 whole days.** 100% fresh on Day 1, still 96% perfect on Day 4. _That’s unheard of!_
- Lovely vanilla and butter flavour **without a greasy mouthfeel**;
- Even, **elegant crumb** – no large tunnels or irregular, crumbly holes;
- Bakes perfectly flat – no levelling required!
- Makes perfect [**cupcakes**](https://www.recipetineats.com/vanilla-cupcakes/);
- Not overly sweet; and    
- As tender as it can be but still be stable enough to make a large layered cake smothered with frosting or piles of cream and berries.
