### Provided services

- Linux servers (dedicated)
- Storage dedicated servers (NVME or SATA HDDs or SSDs)
- AMD EPYC dedicated servers
- GPU dedicated servers
- Collocation
- Telecommunication equipment **colocation**

So you can get **physical dedicated servers** from them (for *storage*, *compute*, *gpu compute*, or anything else). They also provide **colocation** services, meaning you can install your own hardware in their racks.

### Datacenters

All their datacenters are certified **Tier 3** datacenters. 
Which means:
- **N+1 redundancy**. Tier 3 data centers provide N+1 redundant power and cooling distribution paths to allow for routine **maintenance without downtime**
- **Three days of independent power** that is not connected to any outside source is required
- No more than 1.6 hours of downtime per year (99.982% uptime)

The services include database rental, resource rental and software like microsoft 365.

All their datacenters are certified **Tier 3** datacenters as well.

## Hostika

> Website: https://www.hostika.lt/


> [!From the website]
> For more than 11 years we providing high quality hosting services in Europe. Our certified Tier 3 datacenter is located in Vilnius, Lithuania.

### Provided services

- Web Hosting
- VPS Servers
- Dedicated Servers
- Domains Registration
- SSL Certificates

Their datacenter is not owned by them, so there is no colocation service provided, but they provide web hosting, physical and virtual server renting and DNS registration with ssl certificates.

The datacenter they are colocating in is certified **Tier 3**, I won't repeat what this means here.

### Datacenters

They have *1 datacenter in Vilnius* and in 6 other countries. They don't mention the location of their datacenter on their website, just say that it is Tier-3 and not theirs. I think it's a **DELSKA** datacenter, like one used by [[#Hostline]]
