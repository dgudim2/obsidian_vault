## Diagram

![[Pasted image 20260223183454.png]]

> Black rectangles are the racks, green ones are free spaces, cold and hot aisles are marked accordingly.

Hot air from the hot aisles is exhausted via a duct to the ceiling ventilation and circulated back into the room after passing through an HVAC system.

The room is designed to house 10 additional racks. Hot isle exhaust at the ceiling is already designed to accommodate the additional heat load, it's just a matter of connecting the racks with the duct.

If even more racks are required, it's possible to add 4 more at the top or bottom since the wall-to-rack spacing is 3 tiles there.
