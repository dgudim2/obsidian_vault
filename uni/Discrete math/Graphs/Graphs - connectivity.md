## Circuit

> If all [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edges]] of [[#Walk|walk]] are distinct, it called a **circuit**


## Path

> [[#Open / closed walk|Open]] [[#Circuit|circuit]] is called a **path** 

### Length of the path

> **Length of the [[#Path|path]]** is amount of it's [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edges]] (or sum of their *weights*)

### Euler path

> **Euler path** is [[#Path|path]] that goes through every [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edge]] of a graph *exactly once*

> [!note] 
> - If the [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degrees]] of all [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]] of the graph are *not less than 2*, then the graph has at least one [[#Euler path|Euler]] [[#Cycle|cycle]]

> - If the [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degrees]] of *exactly two* [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]] are *odd* numbers, then the **Euler path** exists. 
> 	- Its beginning and end are at [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]] of *odd* [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degrees]] 

#### Euler graph

> If a graph has a [[#Euler path]] and it's a [[#Cycle|cycle]], the graph is called a **Euler** graph

> [!note] 
> [[Graphs - metrics2#Edge graph|Edge graph]] of **Euler graph** has both [[#Euler path|Euler]] and [[#Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian]] [[#Cycle|cycles]].

#### How to find a Euler cycle

1. Take any [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertex]] $v$
2. Find [[Graphs - basics#Properties|adjacent]] vertex $w$. If there are no [[Graphs - basics#Properties|adjacent]] vertices - stop
3. Check if [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edge]] $\{v,w\}$ is a [[#Bridges|bridge]]
	- If [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edge]] is *not* a [[#Bridges|bridge]], add it to the cycle and remove from the graph
	- If [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edge]] *is* a [[#Bridges|bridge]]
		- If *there are more vertices* [[Graphs - basics#Properties|adjacent]] to $v$ - choose another vertex
		- If there are *no* more vertices [[Graphs - basics#Properties|adjacent]] to $v$ - add edge to the cycle and remove it from graph. Go to vertex $w$ and repeat
4. Repeat until no [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edges]] left

### Hamiltonian path

> The **Hamiltonian** [[#Path|path]] is a simple [[#Open / closed walk|open/closed]] [[#Circuit|circuit]] that goes through all [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]] of a graph *exactly once*

> [!theorem] 
> - If a graph has a [[#Bridges|bridge]], then it has *no* **Hamiltonian** [[#Cycle|cycle]]. 
> - If the graph obtained by *removing* this [[#Bridges|bridge]] _has a **Hamiltonian** cycle_, then the *initial* graph _has a **Hamiltonian** path_.

#### Hamiltonian graph

> If a graph has a [[#Hamiltonian path]] and it's a [[#Cycle|cycle]], the graph is called a **Hamiltonian** graph

> [!theorem] 
> If $G(V,E)$ is [[#Connected graph|connected]], has $n$ [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]]. $n\geq 3$ and *every* vertex's *v* [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degree]], $p(v)\geq \frac{n}{2}$, then graph is **Hamiltonian**
> > [!note] 
> > This is not a *necessary* condition, only a *sufficient* one: a graph whose [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degrees]] of all vertices are equal to 2 ([[#Cycle|cycle]]) is *both* an [[#Euler graph|Euler]] and a **Hamiltonian** graph

> [!theorem] 
> If $G(V,E)$ is [[#Connected graph|connected]], has $n$ [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]]. $n\geq 3$ and sum of [[Graphs - basics#Order (degree) of vertices|degrees]] of some [[Graphs - basics#Properties|nonadjacent]] vertices, $p(u)+p(v) \geq n$, then graph is **Hamiltonian** *if and only if* graph with [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edge]] $\{u,v\}$ is **Hamiltonian**
> 
> <u>This leads to the following:</u>
> 
> $G(V,E)$ is **Hamiltonian** *if and only if* it’s [[#Closure|closure]] is **Hamiltonian**
 
> [!note] 
> [[Graphs - metrics2#Edge graph|Edge graph]] of a **Hamiltonian graph** is also **Hamiltonian graph**

#### Cyclomatic number

> **Cyclomatic** number is the number of [[#Independent cycles|independent cycles]] in a graph 
> $G=(V,E)$; 
> $v(G)=m-n+k$
> n - amount of [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs|vertices]]
> m - amount of [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edges]]
> k - amount of [[#Connected components|connected components]]

#### How to determine which cycles are independent

> Which [[#Cycle|cycles]] of a [[Graphs - basics#Complete graph|complete graph]] $K_{5}$ are **independent**?
> 
> $C_{1}=\{v_{5}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}, v_{2}, v_{1}, v_{4}, v_{5}\}$
> $C_{2}=\{v_{5}, v_{2}, v_{1}, v_{4}, v_{5}\}$
> $C_{3}=\{v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}, v_{2}\}$
> $C_{4}=\{v_{5}, v_{1}, v_{3}, v_{4}, v_{5}\}$
> $C_{5}=\{v_{1}, v_{4}, v_{3}, v_{1}\}$

1. Enumerate the [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|edges]] of $K_{5}$: 
	- $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\} - 1$
	- $\{v_{1}, v_{3}\} - 2$
	- $\{v_{1}, v_{4}\} - 3$
	- $\{v_{1}, v_{5}\} - 4$
	- $\{v_{2}, v_{3}\} - 5$
	- $\{v_{2}, v_{4}\} - 6$
	- $\{v_{2}, v_{5}\} - 7$
	- $\{v_{3}, v_{4}\} - 8$
	- $\{v_{3}, v_{5}\} - 9$
	- $\{v_{4}, v_{5}\} - 10$

2. Make vectors for *every* [[#Cycle|cycle]] and fill the table
	- [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|Edge]] $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\}$ is present in $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ but in *reverse order*, we write *-1* in the table for those [[#Cycle|cycles]]
	- [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|Edge]] $\{v_{1}, v_{2}\}$ is *not present* in any other [[#Cycle|cycles]], we write *0* in the table for those [[#Cycle|cycles]]
	- [[Graphs - basics#Undirected graph|Edge]] $\{v_{1}, v_{3}\}$ is present in $C_{4}$ in the *same order*, we write *1* in the table for this [[#Cycle|cycle]]

|         |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  |
| ------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

| $C_{3}$ |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  | -1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |
| $C_{4}$ |  0  |  1  |  0  | -1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
| $C_{5}$ |  0  | -1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | -1  |  0  |  0  |

3. Now we find the *rank* of the matrix

> After simplification we get *4* **independent** [[#Cycle|cycles]]

|         |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |

| $C_{4}$ |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
| $C_{1}$ |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |

#### Cycles base
