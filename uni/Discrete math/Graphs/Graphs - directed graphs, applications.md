# Directed graph

> [!definition] 
> A graph, [[Graphs - basics#Vertices and edges|edges]] of which have *directions*
> See also: [[Graphs - basics#Directed graphs]]

# Applications

## Scheduling

> [!definition] 
> **Executors** - workers performing a task ($V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}$)
> **Tasks** - separate jobs that *can't* be subdivided (Must be performed by *one* **Executor**)
> **Execution times** - a number assigned to each task. (how much time does the task take to execute)
> **Consistency relationships** - are constraints on the order in which tasks are performed. 
> 
> > [!note] 
> > Task *X* precedes Task *Y*, and this means that Task *Y* cannot be started until Task *X* is completed

The main stages of the problem are conveniently described by a [[#Directed graph|directed graph]]:
- Graph [[Graphs - basics#Vertices and edges|vertices]] – tasks
- Arcs (directed [[Graphs - basics#Vertices and edges|edges]]) - Relationships of Consistency.

> Directed graphs describe *relationships* between objects, but these relationships are not necessarily reciprocal

When object is *associated* with another object, this is indicated by an *arrow* pointing from point to point

```

A [[#Directed graph|directed graph]] has *5* tasks and *2* fictive (BEGIN and END) with *0* **execution time**

> The notion *A(6)* means that the execution of task *A* takes *6* units of time
> *A* is executed before *D* (shown by arrow)

### Priority lists

> [!definition] 
> Rules according to which we assign tasks to *executors* based on a *list of priorities* are:
> - **All executors are busy**
> 	- Wait
> - **One executor is free** -
> 	- Review the list of priorities from the beginning, looking for the first *prepared* task, and assign it to that executor. 

#### Random

> [!note] 
> There are $5!=120$ different schedules
> - ! But not every can be fulfilled

- A B C D E 
	- **17** time units

#### Critical path algorithm

- The sums of the [[#Scheduling|execution times]] of all roads running from vertex **X** to vertex **END** must be calculated
- The path with the *biggest sum* is called the *critical path* of vertex **X**
- The sum of the [[#Scheduling|execution times]] of *all tasks* on the *critical path* is called the **project critical time**
- We can use **countercurrent algorithm** to find the *critical path length* of any *vertex* in the project graph
	- The main idea is to start from the vertex **END** and travel back to the vertex **START**

> [!note] 
> If several tasks are *prepared*, take one with the biggest *critical path length*

### Timing

- Suppose we know the **optimal** schedule *time* $T_{opt}$
- Then the *timing* of *any other schedule* will satisfy this inequality
	- $$T\leq ( 2-\frac{1}{N} ) * T_{opt}$$
- **N** - number of *executors*

> [!example] 
> Let **N** = 2, then $$T\leq \frac{3}{2}*T_{opt}$$
> 
> - Suppose we have *2* schedules with times $T_{1}=18$ and $T_{2}=12$
> - $T_{2}<T_{1}$, we can assume that $T_{2}=T_{opt}$, substitute to formula:
> 
> $$T\leq \frac{3}{2} * 12 = 18$$
> 
> We see that $T_{2}=T_{opt}$, and $T_{1}=18$ - *longest* possible schedule

> [!example] 
> Let **N** = 3, and
> 
> $$T\leq \frac{7}{4}*T_{opt}$$
> 
> - Suppose we have a schedule with a *runtime* of $T_{1}=49$
> - Can another timetable be drawn up with a *runtime* of $T_{2}=25$?
> 
> $T_{2}<T_{1}$, then $T_{1} \neq T_{opt}$. Let's substitute
> 
> $$49 \leq \frac{7}{4} * T_{opt}\ \ \ \ \ \ 28 \leq T_{opt}$$
> 
> We see that $T_{2}<T_{opt}$ and it is **impossible**

### Paradoxes

- Paradox of an *additional executor*:
	- It's not always a good idea to add another executor, *the job may take longer*
- Paradox of *faster execution*:
	- It's not always a good idea to reduce task execution time (preparation, etc.), total execution time may increase

### Journey through the matrix

> - Suppose we have a rectangular table with *non-negative* numbers in each cell
> - We travel from the *top left* box to the *bottom right* cell
> - From *all these routes*, we have to choose the one with the *least sum* of *painted cells*
