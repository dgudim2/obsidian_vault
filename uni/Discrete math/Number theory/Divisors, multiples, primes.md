> [!definition] 
> Integer *$a$* is a **multiple** of some integer *$b$* if we can write *$a=bm$*
> Non-zero integer *$b$* **divides** integer *$a$* or $b|a$ (there are several notions), if number *$a$* is itâ€™s **multiple**. Then number *$b$* is called a **divisor** of number *$a$*

> [!theorem] 
> If *$a$*, *$b$* and *$c$* are integers, then
> - For all $a$: $a|a$
> - For all $a$, $b$ and $c$: if $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$
> - For all $a$, $b$ and $c$: $b|a$ and $b|c$ *then and only then* if with any integer numbers $m$ and $n$ $b|(m*a+n*c)$

> [!theorem] 
> - If *$a$* and *$b$* are natural numbers and $a|b$, then $a \leq b$ 
> - IfÂ *$a$* and *$b$* are natural numbers, $a|b$ and $b|a$, then $a=b$ or $a=-b$

> [!theorem] 
> Division with remainder
> 
> If *$a$* and *$b$* are natural numbers, then there is only pair of natural numbers *$q$* and *$r$*, where $0\leq r < b$, such that $a=bq+r$

> [!theorem] 
> - Natural number *$d$* is **common divisor** of numbers *$a$* and *$b$*, if $d|a$ and $d|b$
> - Natural number *$d$* is called *greatest* **common divisor** of numbers *$a$* and *$b$*, if
> 	- It is a **common divisor** and 
> 	- if $c|a$ and $c|b$, then $c|d$ (*$c$* - any **common divisor**)
> - $ Notion $gcd(a;b)$
