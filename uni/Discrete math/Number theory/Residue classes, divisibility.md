# Residue classes

> [!definition] 
> If *$a, b, n$* - natural numbers, and *$n$* divides *$(a-b)$* (*$a/n$* and *$b/n$* have the same **remainder**)
> Then we can write *$a \equiv b(mod\ \ n)$*
> 
> > [!example] 
> > *$10 \equiv 1(mod\ \ 3)$*, since *$3|(10-1)$*
> > *$14 \equiv 4(mod\ \ 5)$*, since *$5|(14-4)$*

> [!theorem] 
> Relation *$\equiv$* is **equivalence** relation (reflective, symmetric and transitive)
> 1. For all integers *$a$* it is true that *$a \equiv a(mod\ \ n)$*
> 2. For all integers *$a$* and *$b$* it is true that: if *$a \equiv b(mod\ \ n)$*, then *$b \equiv a(mod\ \ n)$*
> 3. For all integers *$a$*, *$b$* and *$c$* it is true that: if *$a \equiv b(mod\ \ n)$* and *$b \equiv c(mod\ \ n)$*, then *$a \equiv c(mod\ \ n)$*
