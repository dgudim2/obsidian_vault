# MOST CARS TRADED WILL BE LEMONS

The article talks about a guy named George Akerlof who was studying the second markets in 1960s
Akerlof stated that buyers and sellers have different amounts of information,
and these differences, or asymmetries, can have disastrous consequences for the workings of markets.
The buyer of a second-hand car has less information about its
quality than the seller who already owns the car. The seller will have
been able to assess whether the car is worse than an average
similar car, whether it is a “lemon”
Any buyer that ends up with a lemon feels cheated
The existence of undetectable lemons (cars with undetectable defects) in the market creates uncertainty in the mind of the buyer
In theory this could lead to such low prices that the market
would collapse, and trade would not occur at any price, even if
there are traders willing to buy and sell.

I partially disagree with this. Let's read the flowchart

- The buyer of a second-hand car has less information about its quality than the seller.

Sure, yes, but what about test drives? The customer can just visit the seller and test the car himself.
Although, this requires the customer to be knowledgeable about cars and ideally the seller needs to be near the customer.
Also, what about quality guarantees?

- This inequality of information creates uncertainty for the buyer...

Yes, if the buyer can't do the above things, however, he can still make some assumptions based on the age and mileage of the car.
This also requires some things though, the seller must be honest about the car's specs, at least the basics

- ... who becomes reluctant to pay a high price for any car on the market.

What are the options then, buy a new car? That might be a LOT more expensive
And besides, if the buyer is on a limited budget, he will have no real choice.

- Sellers with good cars therefore withdraw their cars from the market.

Do they though? Why would they do that? They still need to sell the car. If the seller is trustworthy, I see no reason, his cars will still be bought.

- The market begins to collapse because...

I don't think so

... most cars traded will be inferior - lemons.

In some cases, yes, but not most. Maybe I am not understanding something

# THE GOVERNMENT’S PROMISES ARE INCREDIBLE

Following World War 2 economics was dominated by Keynesian thinking.
This claimed that governments could maintain high employment through
two types of discretionary policies: fiscal (government spending and taxation) and monetary (interest rates and the money supply)

In 1977, two economists - Finn Kydland and Edward Prescott published a
paper entitled "Rules Rather than Discretion", which argued that discretionary
policy was in fact self-defeating.

US economist John Muth argued that since having incorrect beliefs about prices is costly,
people seek to minimize their errors by planning ahead.

Before this, macroeconomic models had operated on the
assumption that individuals only look backward, expecting
the future to look the same.

The new model predicted that if people collect information and are rational,
they can and will anticipate government interventions.
They then adapt their actions to the government policy they expect, and
that policy is in turn rendered less effective.

Discretionary policy can only work when individuals are taken by surprise,
and it is hard to surprise rational individuals.

Kydland and Prescott proposed that instead of having a
free reign to set economic policy, governments should use clear rules.
In macroeconomic policy independent
central banks, can place less weight on employment and more
weight on low inflation than the government does. Their control
of monetary policy allows the government to credibly commit to low inflation.


If governments can act at their discretion, they can break their promises, therefore...

... the government’s promises are not credible.

Rational individuals forecast this breaking of promises,
and change their own behavior to suit.

This prevents discretionary government policy from working.

Governments should credibly commit to following
simple rules, not use discretionary policy.

# THE ECONOMY IS CHAOTIC EVEN WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT

Standard economics builds its large-scale predictions - the equilibrium
that an economy will arrive at from the combined effect of the behavior of rational individuals reacting to prices.
Most economic theory is modeled on the laws of motion developed in the 1680s:
every action leads to an outcome, and every event is linked in a causal chain
backward and forward in time in what is called a “linear” process.
But the real world does not behave like that at all.

Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek believed that economics
is far too complex to model. One response to such doubts is complexity theory
Unlike standard economics, this approach recognizes that predictable,
regular actions by individuals do not necessarily lead to a stable, predictable economy.

In 1975, French economists Jean-Michel Grandmont and Alan Kirman argued that
economies are “complex systems.”
In standard economic models with perfect competition individuals do not interact directly, they just respond to prices,
constantly changing their behavior and prices to achieve the best outcome
and don't always use rational calculations, sometimes using “rules of thumb”.

- Economists assume that individuals act rationally
and that all events are determined by cause and effect.

This is a weird thing to assume, people are not robots and the world is not a computer simulation (probably),
there are a LOT of variables to take into account

- This means that the economy should be predictable.

It is predictable if you take all the variables into account
This is simply not feasible

- But economies are complex systems, and individuals may each act
slightly differently to any given event.

Yes, that's true

- These small differences can lead to a myriad of different outcomes.

Yes they do)

- The economy is chaotic even when individuals are not.

I have 2 examples.
Take 1 pendulum, it's motion will be predictable
Take 3 and chain them together, their combiner motion will be very chaotic and very hard to predict

Or

Shoot a pinball in physical pinball game, it's very hard to predict the ball

SOCIAL NETWORKS ARE A KIND OF CAPITAL

Let's be clear, we are not talking about facebook or twitter here, or any of that stuff really

The word "capital" refers to different things:
Machinery used in production: physical capital.
Skills of the labor force: human capital.

The efficient use of physical and human capital has
long been recognized as key to an economy,

But in the 1990s US political scientist Robert Putnam suggested
a less tangible form of capital, made up of social connections.
He argued that social networks are also important to
economic performance.

The interactions between people at work, in their community, and in
their leisure time, can be considered “social capital.”

Social networks help individuals improve their skills, advance their
careers, and increase overall productivity by encouraging
cooperation and information sharing. Conversely, when these
connections dwindle, economic performance suffers.

Putnam pointed out that people in developed countries have
become more isolated, living in urban areas
with little sense of community.




Yeah, the guy has a point

EDUCATION IS ONLY A SIGNAL OF ABILITY


Michael Spence said, if Person 1 has more information than Person 2
in a transaction, Person 1 is likely to send a signal to allow Person 2 to
make a more informed decision.

The example Spence gave was that of the job interview, where an
employer has less information than the applicant about his or her
potential productivity. The applicant provides a resume detailing educational
achievements, which may have no relevance to the post applied for but
do signal a willingness for hard work and application.
In Spence’s view higher education, unlike vocational training,
mostly has a signaling function
