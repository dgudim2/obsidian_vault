- 923,769 square kilometres
- 230 million people

# Macroeconomic measures






# GDP - 1st slide

- It is 31st place in the world by the GDP
- In 2022 the GDP was 477 billion dollars
- There was a dip in 2009, 2014 - 2017, 2020
- 2009 - armed rebellion against the government
- 2020 - COVID

But per capita, the GDP is just 2184 because of the number of people living there
In comparison, in Lithuania, GDP per capita is 24826 (move than 10 times more)

# GDP growth - 2nd slide

On this graph we can more clearly see changes in GDP

# GDP comparison - 3d slide

If we compare the GDP of Nigeria, Egypt and Lithuania, we can see that GDP of both African countries coincide, while our is much lower

# Unemployment and poverty rate

Now let's look at poverty and unemployment rates
It's pretty bad.
One thing we can see is that for some reason unemployment rate dropped from 33% to 4% in one year.
But they just changed the methodology (The new methodology defines employed individuals as those of working age people who engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay and profit during the review period. This compares with the initial methodology of anybody who engaged in any productive activity for at least 20 hours a week)

- 5th worst poverty rate.
- Big difference between states (Lagos - 4.5, Sokoto - 87.7)

# Inflation

Inflation is pretty good, this data is from 1998, so overall, the trend is almost linear
Although, in recent years from 2019 it's been growing
Overall I would say that it's fine reaching just 18%
However, as we discussed in the previous lecture, inflation can be different and this one is bad because it's not the government controlling it and it also influences food prices

# Inflation comparison

But if we compare it other countries, we see that is has also been growing in Egypt and in Lithuania, so it's not just Nigeria






# FISCAL SECTOR






# National debt

National debt reached 124 billion dollars in Q1 2023, which is quite a lot considering the GDP, and is projected to increase even higher
National dept is amount of money the country has borrowed. High national means less flexibility to respond to crisis and fewer economic opportunities


# Budget surplus and deficit

This shows that expenditure has eclipsed the revenue, because they have to borrow, which is why there is a deficit
Government spends more money on public programs, services, and debt servicing than it collect through taxes, ect
The COVID-19 has made it even worse

# Economic dynamics and issues






# Economic sector

If we look at GDP distribution across economic sectors we can see that a quarter is taken up by agriculture, 15% by Information and communication and manufacturing, 13% by trade, etc

# Circular economy

Nigeria, with a population of over 200 million people generates huge quantities of
solid waste as a result of the take-use-dispose approach, which has been
estimated to be more than 32 million tonnes yearly.

Recent surveys carried out in the country indicate that less than 20% of the waste
generated is collected through the formal system while less than 10% is recycled.

The rest of the waste ends up in open and unlined dump sites, water bodies,
drainages, farmland, open spaces, e.t.c. Burning of such wastes openly is also a
common practice particularly at the dump sites where hazardous and non-
hazardous wastes are co-disposed without any form of separation or segregation.

This state of affairs presents grave dangers to the Nigerian environment
and her citizens as incidences of sanitation and environment related
diseases are on the increase. The problem is being exacerbated by rapid
population explosion, unplanned urbanization, changes in consumption
patterns, inadequate waste management infrastructure, poor funding, lack
of credible data e.t.c.

# Blue economy

Nigeria has more than 853km of coastline, but issues such as oil spills and piracy have thus far prevented its blue economy from taking off.
The blue economy holding particular promise for the southern state of Bayelsa, given that its coastline expands over 180km, the longest of any state in Nigeria.

Bayelsa State has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with a European consortium known as the African Atlantic Gulf of Guinea Fisheries to develop a massive aquaculture project that includes setting up a 300-hectare offshore aquaculture farm, a 20,000-metric-tonne capacity fish processing plant and a boatbuilding yard across the state’s three senatorial districts

# Green economy

- There is a conflict between Nigeria’s dependence on oil for its economic wellbeing, and the sustainable development the nation strives to achieve.

- The country is the largest oil and gas producer in Africa and the fourth largest gas producer in the world. Resource extraction is the most important sector of the economy.

- Major renewable energy resources include solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, and tidal waves. However there is lack of access to affordable and reliable energy services.

- There are numerous unexplored sectors in Nigeria where Green Economy initiatives can be adopted, including transportation, housing, food processing, fashion, and in various manufacturing sectors.

# Defense economy

The cumulative amount of resources devoted to security in Nigeria, remains largely opaque.
As at present, Nigerians hold the view that insecurity ranks very high in their daily and general concerns.
For the amount of money, the Federal and State governments devote to security, most Nigerians
think that national security architecture is not as effective as it should be. This thinking comes on
the basis of very tangible realities: kidnapping, piracy, banditry, armed robbery and more.
Today Nigeria is ranked 42nd out of 138 countries in global military strength. Yet the
Nigerian defence sector is not a wealth generation sphere.

# Monetary economy

Central bank - Central Bank of Nigeria is responsible for the country's monetary policy.

(In 2021, monetary policy focused on easing the impact of shocks on the Nigerian economy which emanated from supply-side disruptions, post-lockdown and poor acceptance and roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines)

Interest rates are a key tool in monetary policy. The bank uses interest rates to control the money supply and influence inflation rates.







# Economic issues and possible solutions

https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nigeria/overview

# Issues

1. Limited opportunities to most of the citizens
	- A Nigerian born in 2020 was expected to be 36% as productive as they could have been if they had full access to education and health

2. The poverty rate is very high, with an estimated 84 million Nigerians living below the poverty line

3. Spatial inequality
	- Best-performing regions of Nigeria comparing favorably to middle-income countries
	- Worst performing states fall below the average for low-income

4. Wide infrastructure gaps constrain access to electricity and hinder the domestic economic integration

5. In most areas of Nigeria service delivery is limited and insecurity and violence are widespread


# Solutions

- Focus on the tradable services sector
	- (80 percent of workers are employed in sectors with low levels of productivity - agriculture and non-tradable services)

- Implement some kind of programs to upskill young people to take full advantage of this sector

- Expand the manufacturing sector
	- The sector has a much higher productivity level than agriculture and can accommodate the kind of labor that is abundant in the country
