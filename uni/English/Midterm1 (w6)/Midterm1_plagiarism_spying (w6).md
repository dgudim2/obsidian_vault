1. As the Turnitin database expands, it becomes more robust at detecting plagiarism, because as it grows, it obtains more samples of essays and papers, so it will be more difficult for subsequent submissions to be plagiarized, especially if those new papers take content from the papers already in the database.

2. While you may certainly get away with writing a paper with plagiarized content and then fine tuning it using the Turnitin service to make it pass the plagiarism checks. In this case you are not doing yourself any good, you are basically fooling yourself.

1. In my opinion, such practices are unethical and maybe should even be considered illegal. Watching and eavesdropping on shoppers violates their privacy, especially when shops do it without shoppers' consent. Adding insult to injury, you don't really know what they are doing with this information, if say this company signs an agreement with another company to share this data, or maybe with the government, or maybe they deploy some kind of AI face recognition system to uniquely identify you and make a profile.

2. Reiterating on the previous statement, if the stores don't notify that you are being recorded and by what means, this should be considered illegal. The stores should notify people about surveillance using clear visible signs, and maybe even put one near every mannequin with a camera.

3. This will definitely change my shopping behavior, I wont even shop in those places as I will feel really uncomfortable. Being recorded by regular security cameras is one thing and is understandable, being recorded for the sole purpose of marketing and you spending more money on things you may not necessarily need is a totally different thing.

4. Expanding on the previous statement, being recorded for security and for commercial gain are polar opposite things, those mannequins stand at your eye level, providing better face image quality and allowing for eavesdropping. This allows shop owners to more efficiently spy on you.
