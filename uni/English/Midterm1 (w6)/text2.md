# Those Mannequins Are Watching You

Store mannequin maker Almax (www.almax-italy.com) is deploying the EyeSee, a mannequin equipped with technology that is typically used to identify criminals at airports. The mannequins allow retailers to gather demographic data and shopping patterns from customers as they move through stores. Although retailers are reluctant to discuss the mannequins' use, Almax claims that several companies are using them in three European countries and the United States.

From the outside the EyeSee looks like an ordinary mannequin. Internally, however, a camera in one eye feeds data into demographic-profiling software to determine each customer's age, gender, and race. To give the EyeSee ears as well as eyes, Almax is developing technology that recognizes words. This feature will allow retailers to eavesdrop on shoppers' comments regarding the mannequins' attire.

The EyeSee is designed for merchants who increasingly use technology to help personalise their product offerings. Merchants are enthusiastic over technology that can help profile customers while keeping their customers' identities anonymous.

Whereas some stores deploy similar technology to watch shoppers from overhead security cameras, Almax contends that the EyeSee provides better data because it stands at eye level and thus invites customer attention. The mannequin revealed to one store that men who shopped in the first two days of a sale spent more money than women did. Another store discovered that one in three visitors who accessed one of its doors after 4 p.m. were Asian, prompting the store to place Chinese-speaking staff by that entrance.

Regulations imposed by the United States and Europe permit the use of cameras for security purposes, but they also require retailers to place signs in their stores warning customers that they may be filmed. Watching people solely for commercial gain could be construed as gathering personal data without consent. One legal expert notes that when you access Facebook, before you start the registration process, you can see exactly what information the site will collect and what the site will do with that information. In contrast, with the EyeSee, what can customers do? Almax counters that because the EyeSee does not store any images, retailers can use it as long as they have a closed-circuit television license.
