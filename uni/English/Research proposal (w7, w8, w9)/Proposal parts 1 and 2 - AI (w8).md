	- image recognition
	- video generation
2. ? What are some of the pros and cons of each?
	- Pros: 
		- Faster and easier,
	- Cons: 
		- no jobs
		- not always accurate
		- deepafakes
3. ? s a student, how may AI be useful for you?
	- Summarizing information
	- solving exams
4. ? What are some of the ethical implications connected to AI in the mentioned fields?
	- Stealing information (derivative vs ... work)
5. ? Do you think that AI could be implemented into your classes at university successfully?
	- I don’t think so, the tech staff couldn't even implement 2-factor right
6. ? What kind of research could you do into AI?
    - What questions could you ask? 
        - What do you use it for?
        - Do you use AI for essays
        - Are you afraid of losing your job?
        - Will the AI influence life expectancy (medicine)
    - What methodologies could you employ?
        - Questionnaires
        - Surveys
        - 1-to-1 interview
        - Focus groups
        - Observation
    - What participants do you have access to?
        - Students
        - Friends
        - Family
        - Lecturers
        - Collegues
    - How could you analyse the data you found?
        - Statistical (numerical)
        - Opinion-based 


# Academic Article - AI in the Classroom

1.  Who are the Authors of the article?
    - Rainer Winkler
    - Julian Roos

2. What is the general topic of the article?
    - Designing smart personal assistants for learning tutors (SPAs) (AI into the Classroom)


3. What year and where was the article published?
    - 2019
    - AIS Electronic Library (AISeL) /  Fortieth International Conference on Information Systems, Munich

4. What is the aim of this study? (Abstract)
    - The objective of our study is to find and validate a general set of design principles that educators can use to design their own agents.

5. What changes are happening in the education sector which make AI or SPA’s more important? (Introduction)
    - Large scale lectures at universities
    - Ever-growing classrooms at high schools
    - Massive open online courses (MOOCs)

6. What do the following sources tell us about the topic background?
    1. Glaserfeld 1987
        - Individual support is crucial for an increased learning success 
    2. Nwana 1990
        - Especially the research stream of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) has been extensively investigating the value of ITS to improve students’ learning outcomes over the last thirty or forty years
        - An ITS is a computer system that aims to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners
    3. Nye et al 2018
        - Existing ITS have still found too little entry into learning environments 
    4. Elaine 2015
            i. Requires a lot of technical knowledge and a lot of time

7. What do the authors hope to do after conducting their research? (Conclusion/Contribution)
    - Regarding practical implications, we exemplarily show educators how to build SPAs for their own learning environments.


# Part 1- Background Information

> Using this article as a primary source and focusing on the topic of ‘AI in the classroom’ think about the various parts of the background information section. 
> With the person next to you try to write ideas in the following sections (1 or 2 sentences)
> Use the prompts to help you.

## TOPIC
Nowadays technology is becoming an increasingly important aspect of teaching / supporting the lecturer / the learning process / everyday life, but in teaching AI is used rarely

## RESEARCH
According to Glaserfeld for better learning experience it is important for lecturers to help students individually / have 1-to-1 communication (1987, in Winkler and Roos, 2019)
In their study Winkler and Roos found that they could design a system to help teachers design an ITS (2019)
One of the reasons that SPA’s haven’t been used in education could be their complexity of implementation and usage.


## RESEARCH GAP
Although there is research on SPAs and ITSes there is little on the area of teachers opinions on these things.


## THESIS STATEMENT
The aim of my research would be to find out how students and teachers at VGTU feel about using AI in the classroom.


# PART 2 - Research Questions

> Write four research questions for the following thesis statement.  Think about what you would like to find out, who you would like to ask
> ‘The aim of the study is to see whether SPA’s could be implemented into academic life at VGTU.’

1. Ask lecturers: Are you comfortable with using AI in the classroom
2. Ask Tech staff: Do you have proper infrastructure for implementing this.
3. Ask teachers/students: How will the SPA’s improve the work-flow?
4. Ask students: Are you comfortable with using this tech / do you want to see it implemented?
5. Which classes will the AI be most effective for?
