# Overcoming the limitations of electronic commerce in the developing world

1. Describe how the The Yong Village officials Farm and Jumia are trying to overcome the limitations of electronic commerce. Provide specific examples to support your answer.

One of the limitation is that when you are shopping online, you can't physically see the product. To keep customers interested and trusting, Zhang documents and photographs everything on social media to assure customers of the quality control.
While an online shop provides a convenient way for people to order, someone need to do logistics management and handling of the orders. This is solved by Zhang, she manages all the shipping, logistics, quality control and communication with the farmers about the order.

Often, when you buy something in an online shop, you pay upfront and using your card. People in Nigeria are suspicions of paying online and fear online fraud. Jumia overcomes this by accepting payment on delivery (even cash) and offering free returns. And for people who are still skeptical or have some questions, Jumia hols impromptu shopping sessions showing consumers how to order and answer questions

2. What are the advantages of electronic commerce to rural farmers in China

People living in rural have less connections and customers than people from urban areas, besides, they may have different dialects, which makes it even harder to communicate with people from urban areas. So a solution to this is online shops, with the use of such shops people have wider reach and awareness. With online shops you can even sell to people from different countries. Because of this wider reach, they have increased income.

3. What are the advantages of electronic commerce to the people in Nigeria

Historically, shopping locally in Nigeria meant higher prices, sitting in traffic and less selection. Ordering online frees you from at least two of those issues - prices and sitting in traffic. With online commerce you can order from any manufacturer from the comfort of your home. Also, Jumia uses motorbikes to deliver goods, which lowers congestion and delivery time, so you get your item even faster.




# Predicting airplane arrivals more accurately

1. Do you think that satellite-based navigation will meet resistance among air traffic controllers? Why or why not?

It depends on various factors, but I think mostly no, as this technology does not replace air traffic controllers, this is merely a tool to make their job easier and airline operation more efficient. As long as they got to keep their job and salary we wont see much backlash from air traffic controllers.

2. Do you think that pilots will object to having "smart assistants" help them make decisions? Why or why not?

This is similar to the air traffic controllers' situations. Pilots still got to keep their job, it's just that now some responsibility is shifted towards "smart assistants", and if the pilot's decision differs from that of a "smart assistant", the pilot is still in charge and can ignore the "smart assistant". I think they wont object, they will be for them.

3. Do you think that overall response of the airlines to satellite-based navigation and smart assistants for pilots will be positive or negative? Support your answer.

Expanding from the previous answers. I think that overall response will be positive. Nowadays we not only have smart assistants for pilots, we have full-on autopilots, but human pilots are still needed for critical and unexpected situations. Same goes for the traffic controllers, we can't fully replace them, human factor, unexpected conditions and situations are still a thing and always will be.

4. What is the relationship between analytics and smart assistant for pilots?

Analytics is just data for pilots to base decisions on, smart assistant on the other hand use that analytics to make decisions by themselves so the pilot can compare their decision with that of a smart assistant.
