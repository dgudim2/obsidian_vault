# 7.2 Overcoming the Limitations of Electronic Commerce in the Developing World

## China

A series of food safety scandals has created a demand in China's
big cites for natural or traditionally grown food. Two beneficiaries
of this new market are Li Chengcai (83 years old) and Cheng You-
fang (76 years old), who grow radishes on their tiny farm. Although
the couple are illiterate and speak only their local dialect, they sell
their produce via electronic commerce to urban customers who
are willing to pay extra for flavorful, safe food. Here is how they
became engaged in e-commerce.

Zhang Yu, a 26-year-old “young village official—that is her
actual title—and other young village officials launched an account
on Sina Weibo (ttp://english.sina.com/weibo), a Chinese micro-blogging Web site,
to post items about the fresh, traditionally grown
produce of their region. Soon afterward, they opened an online
store through Alibaba Group's Taobao (www.engtaobac.com)
Web site to connect local farmers with urban buyers. The online
grocery, officially known as the Young Village Officials’ Farm, has
customers in Bejing, Shanghai, and elsewhere, and about 10,000
followers on Weibo. Customers place orders online, and Zhang
visits farmers to verbally inform them of the order. Zhang handles
the logistics, shipping, and quality control of the produce.

Zhang maintains the reason for the success of the grocery is
a renewed interest in local farming traditions—which she documents
in photographs on social media—and strict quality control.
In an area where the average monthly household income is only
about 600 yuan (§98), farmers selling produce through the online
grocery stores can increase their income by one-third.

## Nigeria

There s an old saying in Nigeria that “You can outfit your entire
home in a single drive across Lagos (Nigeria's largest city).” Today,

any location in the city within a single day, and anywhere in the
entire country within five days.

In early 2015, Jumia had 1,500 employees. In addition to Nigeria,
the company operates in Kenya, Morocco, ivory Coast, Egypt,
Uganda, and South Africa. Although not yet profitable, Jumia
claims monthly revenues of “a couple of million” dolars as well
as rapidly increasing sales. Significantly, in 2014 Jumia secured
additional funding totaling €120 million.

you can buy everything from cutlery and furniture to food and
décor from the thousands of hawkers who aggressively sell their
goods along, and in the middle of, the congested city's potholed
streets. Unfortunately, shopping locally historically has meant
higher prices, less selection, and often sitting in traffic for hours to
get o stores, which rely on generators to cope with almost daily
power outages.

Today, however, Nigerians have another option for comprehensive
shopping: the online marketplace Jumia (www.jumicom.ng).
For example, when Gbemiga Omotoso bought a Samsung tablet in 2014,
he handed over his h to a man in a van.
The transaction was part of online retailer Jumia's attempt to
adapt its operation to the unique challenges of selling in Nigeria.
With many of the country’s 160 million residents suspicious
of paying online, the Lagos-based retailer wins over skeptical
shoppers by accepting payment on delivery and offering free
returns.

Jumia and local rival Konga (wwiw.konga.com) are delivering
electronics, clothes, and even refrigerators to Nigerians’ front
doors. To combat fears of online fraud and to educate Nigerians
about shopping online securely, the company employs a direct
sales team of about 200 who travel around major cities such as
Lagos and Port Harcourt carrying tablet computers. They wear
outfits displaying Jumia's logo. and they hold impromptu shopping
sessions in businesses, churches, and homes, showing consumers
how to order and answering questions.

Jumia is building its own fleet of about 200 vehicles. Almost
70 percent are motorbikes that are easier to navigate through the
country’s traffic jams. To keep robberies at a minimum, the last
deliveries take place at 7 PM. The company promises lo deliver
any item in its 90,000 square foot central warehouse in Lagos to
