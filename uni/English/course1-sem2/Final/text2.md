# 12.2 Predicting Airplane Arrivals More Accurately

Air travelers are accustomed to long flight delays and cancellations
for any number of reasons. Few customers realize that air-
lines themselves are not particularly accurate at predicting when a
flight will arrive at its destination even when it is ready to leave the
gate. Making a pinpoint-accurate prediction on gate arrival times is
notoriously tricky, because many factors alter flight times. Weather
and wind are the most common, but there are also ground issues,
such as the passenger who neglects to board his flight on time,
forcing the airline to delay departure while they offload his luggage.
As a result, airline predictions are off by an average of seven
minutes across the industry.

Flights normally operate according to a flight plan put together
a few hours in advance of a flight's scheduled departure. After the
flight takes off it is tracked by a dispatcher, who may be monitoring
15 flights simultaneously. So, for example, if headwinds increase,
then the pilot must talk to a dispatcher, who may decide
to reprogram the “cost index” of the flight, revise the flight plan,
and give permission to the pilot to pick up speed (and therefore
use more fuel) to arrive on time.

Airiness have been looking to automate these kinds of processes
to save costs and also fo provide travelers with a better
flying experience. Gary Beck, vice president of fight operations for
Alaska Airlines, maintains that airlines need to eliminate the human
part of these communications in favor of automation.

To encourage this process, Alaska Aidines (www.alaskaair.com)
and General Electric (GE) (www.ge.com) sponsored a Flight

Quest contest aimed at developing an algorithm that could help
airlines better predict flight arrival times and reduce passenger
delays. The contest, which was st up on the contest Web site
Kaggle (www.kaggle.com), provided contestants with two months
of flight data, such as arrivals, departures, weather, and latitudes
and longitudes along the routes. Such data are typically not avail-
able to the public because they are owned by the airlines and
manufacturers.

A team from Singapore won the contest and the $100,000
prize. The winning algorithm produced fight arrival estimates that
were nearly 40 percent more accurate than existing estimates.
The algorithm could help airlines reduce gate congestion, manage
crews more efficiently, and save travelers up to five minutes at the
gate. Each minute saved in a flight saves $1.2 million in annual
crew costs and $5 million in annual fuel savings for a mid-sized airline.

A second Flight Quest contest, with a $250,000 prize, challenged
data scientists to determine the most efficient flight routes,

speeds, and altitudes at any moment, taking into account variables
such as weather, wind, and airspace constraints. The winning model
proved to be up to 12 percent more efficient when
compared with data from past actual fights.

GE plans to develop software and services that incorporate
the results of the two Flight Quest contests. It is important to note
that GE's goal is not o replace pilot decisions, but to create smart
assistants for pilots.

It may take some time, however, before software can be used
to fundamentally change how commercial flights operate. For
example, Alaska Airlines, which frequently lands planes under difficult
weather conditions, has pioneered the use of satellite navigation,
as opposed to relying on ground-based instruments. The
use of satellite navigation lowers the standard minimum elevations
for a plane’s approach upon landing. The airline is working with
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to spread the technique,
which also saves fuel, to the lower 48 states. Beck claims that
the greatest challenge has been 1o alter the practices and official
handbooks of air traffic controllers, who would no longer need
1o tell planes where and when to tum. He maintains that satellite
navigation systems essentially transform air traffic controllers into
air traffic monitors.
