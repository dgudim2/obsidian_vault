# TOPIC - Cloud computing

> Look at the pictures below and discuss the following questions


1. ? What are these five personal cloud services?  Which do you use and why?
- Gdrive
- One drive
- Dropbox
- ICloud
- Teams

2. ? What different industries are shown in the images below?  How can cloud computing benefit these?  What could be a possible drawback for each?

- Construction
- Manufacturing
- Photography
- Medicine
- Education 

Advantages: 
- $ Share, ease of access, collaboration, easy setup (for big companies), easily scalable

Disadvantages:
- ! The data is not yours, if the cloud goes down you can’t access the files and resources, if the connection is slow it becomes unusable, need internet connection constantly


3. ? What do you know about the three main types of cloud services? (see fig 3.4)

- Infrastructure as a service (IAAS)
	- You bring your own OS, applications and data (Hosting)
- Platform as a service (PAAS)
	- You bring your applications and data (Also hosting (Azure))
- Software as a service (SAAS)
	- You use what is provided (Microsoft active directory, Cloud drives)

# Academic Article - Cloud Computing in Education 

1. ? Who are the Authors of the article?
	- Zoleixa Asadi, Mohammadhiwa Abdekhoda Haidar Nadrian

2. ? What is the general topic of the article?
	- Cloud computing services adoption among higher education faculties

3. ? What year and where was the article published?
	- Education and Information Technologies (2020) (Use this year)
	- % (Published online: 15 July 2019. Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019)

5. ? What is the aim of this study? (Abstract)
	- To develop and validate an instrument to investigate the determinants (reasons) of cloud computing services (development of a standardized questionnaire)

6. ? What is the rationale for the article?
	- Our findings in the present study demonstrated validity, reliability, simplicity and functionality of the TPB-CCSQ. (questionnaire)

7. ? Find sources from the article: what do they tell us about the topic background?
	- The acceptance of a technology by individuals leads to application of the technology (Amoako-Gyampah and Salam 2004)
	- It is predicted that the CCSs will grow up to $216 Billion by 2020 (Naveen Mishra 2017, p 176)
	- Educational organizations have applied CC as it reduced the costs and increased the efficiency (Alshuwaier et al. 2012)
	- Several previous studies, however, have suggested concerns with privacy and security as important determinants for CCSs use (Hussein and Khalid 2016; González-Martínez et al. 2015)

8. ? What do the authors hope to do after conducting their research / what do they hope their research will help with? (Conclusion/Contribution)
	- To the best of our knowledge, this tool is the only TPB-based scale developed to investigate the cognitive determinants of CCSs use in educational settings. 
	- Such investigations may provide decision makers and stakeholders in educational settings with finest available information prior to designing interventional programs aiming at CCSs use promotion
	- Further studies in different educational settings are recommended to compare the dimensions of instrument in different communities


# PART 5 - Conclusion / Contribution

> The final paragraph (paragraphs or section) is the conclusion.  It must contain the following information

- **CONCLUSION**
	- A concluding statement where you sum up all that you have written 
	- In conclusion, as we can see.....
- **RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION/IMPLICATION**
	- What the result of your research would have on the field 
	- By doing this we would find out……This would benefit the field of IT because…
- **CITATION**
	- A citation from your source materials highlighting the relevance of your chosen topic 
	- As Smith suggest, the importance of cloud computing is only going to increase….(Smith, 2019, p.23)

## Using information from the academic article and your own ideas, complete the information below, then write notes to complete the final section of a Research Proposal

- THESIS STATEMENT
	- The aim of the proposed research would be to analyze staff and student attitudes towards widespread use of CC within all departments of VGTU

- RESEARCH QUESTIONS (x2)


- $ Conclusion 
	- In conclusion, as we can see that both students and staff accepted the used of CC in all spheres of educational process

- $ Citation
	- The acceptance of a technology by individuals leads to application of the technology (Amoako-Gyampah and Salam 2004, in Asadi et al. 2010, p176)

- $ Implication
	- By doing this we would find out what's the attitude towards extended use of CCs in educational environment. This would benefit the field of IT because it would allow them to tailor the services and make them more appealing to the end users
