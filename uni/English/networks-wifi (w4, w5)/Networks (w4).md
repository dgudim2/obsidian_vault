- Which features make 5G Technology different from the previous ones?  
>[!tldr]
>   - more speed
  > - lower latency
  > - 1000x bandwidth per unit area
  > - 90% reduction in network energy use
  > - feasibility to connect 10 to 100 number of devices

- How is this technology designed? What is its primary goal? 
> [!tldr]
>   - Entirely IP based model designed for the wireless and mobile networks
>   - The IP technology is designed exclusively to ensure sufficient control data for appropriate routing of IP packets related to a certain application connection
>   
  > - Ability of devices to identify their geographical location as well as weather
  > - It promptly distinguishes the changes in its environment and hence respond accordingly to provide uninterrupted quality service.

- Why is 5G Technology so beneficial?  
> [!tldr]
>  - Our world would have universal and uninterrupted access to information, communication, and entertainment that will open a new dimension to our lives and will change our life style meaningfully.
>  
>  - The features and its usability are much beyond the expectation of a normal human being. With its ultra-high speed, it is potential enough to change the meaning of a cell phone usability.

- How will the fifth generation of mobile communication networks influence our future life?  
> [!tldr]
>  - now your smart phone would be more parallel to the laptop

## The advantages and disadvantages of 5G High speed wireless networking

5G Wireless networking is the new big thing in cellular communication. It offers a substantial bandwidth increase and decrease in latency over 4G, moreover, it can support a greater number of devices per unit area. All this leads to a better user experience and satisfaction. However, this technology is a double-edged sword, namely, the cost of deploying 5G infrastructure is high, thus limiting its scope to developed countries. Another drawback is cell tower coverage, due to 5G using millimeter waves which don't travel as far, more towers are needed to cover the same area. The last drawback is that for most end users speed provided by 4G is already enough, this is also backed by the fact that most servers won't even allow you to download content at high speeds provided by 5G, so providers don't see the point in spending money on upgrades if the users are satisfied with the current solutions.
