Hello





======================= Slide 1:

I'm going to talk about 2 atlassian products: jira and confluence
and one integration which is usually used from inside jira





======================= Slide 2:

First - jira, what is jira?
Jira is web app made by atlassian.
It's used for all your tracking and project management needs: Issue, bug and task tracking,
project and sprint management.

Some companies using Jira include
Datadog
Udemy
Coinbase
General motors

In addition to the base functionality, you can extend jira with plugins,
it has integration with other Atlassian products and with version control systems.





======================= Slide 3:

For the technical part, jira is written in Java, uses some apache components and WebWork 1 technology stack.
Provider REST and xml interfaces.

Jira comes in 3 flavours:

Jira Software - the base package, including agile project management features
Jira Service Management - for IT operations and service desks.
Jira Align - for product and portfolio management.


For hosting you can either host it on your own hardware and pay for the licence,
or let Atlassian host it for you on AWS (So you can experience AWS outages with everyone else)

Here are the prices for cloud deployment. 9$ per user for standard and 18$ per user for premium
While it makes sense to pay per user in the cloud because you re increasing load with each user,
it makes less sense when running on-prem.
But on prem you pay per-user as well, just a bit less

You can get Jira for free if you are a non-academic, non-commercial, non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization





======================= Slide 4:

So why would you want to use jira
Well, if used properly, can make project management easier for the whole team
It's quite flexible, you can extend it with plugin and integrations
It's configurable as well, you can change a log of settings to suit your flow



======================= Slide 5:

And here are the reasons against.

The extensibility of Jira is also its biggest drawback

Configuring it properly requires good project management skills.
Projects managers can install a million extensions, and expect you,
the developer to be more productive, while it's the opposite -
you have to fill out a million fields and navigate the messy ui.

This leads to developers working to produce good statistics for
project managers instead of doing actual work.

Also, even though its flexible, sometimes it feels like
core features are missing, like granular email notification controls
or good keyboard shortcuts.


======================= Slide 6:

When talking about the UI
I usually like when the interface provides all the controls
at a glance and uses screen space efficienly, but here, well,
here half of the fields are never used, so they are visual clutter.
I had to inject custom css rules into jira to clean the UI up, since you
can't disable or move them from the UI.




======================= Slide 7:

There are some great alternatives to jira.
Here are 3 open source ones.
I only tried OpenProject, it's better in some areas,
like the gantt chart, and work in others - like the kanban board





======================= Slide 8:
Next up, confluence

This is another product made by Atlassian.

This one is a web wiki for organizing your documentation.

Companies using confluence are mostly the same as those using
jira because those products integrate nicely and it makes sense to use them together

You can also extend confluence with plugins (I use the d2 plugin at work a lot for diagrams), although there is
no integration with version control systems out of the box






======================= Slide 9:

For the technical part, confluence is written in Java as well, uses Apache tomcat and string boot
Provider REST and xml interfaces as well


Hosting and pricing are basically the same as with jira. On premise or in the cloud. the price is a bit lower though.





======================= Slide 10:

Why would you want to use confluence?


Well, if you are using other atlassian products already, it's quite convenient, the integration is nice
If you want a central place to manage your wiki instead of storing the documentation per-project.


======================= Slide 11:


And here are some reason why not.

Even though it's a wiki, the search is sub-par, you can't always find what you are looking for,
it doesn't search inside documents on text on images.

It can become messy and desynchronised with the project documentation
in the repositories, version control integration is a MUST have.

The format of notes is xml, so exporting to other system is not straight-forward.



======================= Slide 12:

Here are some alternatives to confluence

MkDocs, XWiki and GItlab
All of them store documents in markdown, so that's a clear advantage,
can't say about the experience, because I've never used any.
But what I can say, is that having wiki in GitLab seems like a great idea
because you are storing your documentation with your projects with proper version control




======================= Slide 13:

And for the last product - zephyr
This is a SmartBear product, not Atlassian, but it can be used from inside Jira as a plugin

It's used for test management and organization

And here are some companies using it
Epam
Fujitsu
AT&T
Qualcom





======================= Slide 14:



For the technical part, it's written in java and uses Apache tomcat as well, like confluence and uses Elasticsearch for indexing.
That's for the standalone 'enterprise' edition. When running as a jira plugin it uses the same stack as jira.


There are several editions: as a jira plugin, or as a standalone service, both can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud.
For the jira plugin version, there are 2 editions: squad for smaller teams and scale for bigger one.
You can see the pricing here, it's not per user, but per team size





======================= Slide 15:


Why would you want to use it?

The reasons are mostly the same as with confluence.
You are an existing Jira user, this plugin feels like
a part of the system when installed and not as a separate addition
And the test management is good, I'm mostly satisfied with it.


Why mostly, because there is no integration with automated testing and CI/CD for releases.
The analytics are very basic and it's not very flexible, you either use it, or choose something else.
And of course, the ui, it's using Jira UI, so it's just as bad.



======================= Slide 16:

Th test window takes up only like half of your screen horizontally and a third vertically,
when I'm editing a test, I want it fullscreen.
The copy and delete step buttons are too small and there are no keyboard shortcuts for
marking the state of current item, completing the test or switching between section.
I had to add all of that myself with custom css and javascript.



======================= Slide 17:

Thanks
