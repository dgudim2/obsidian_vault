## Task 1 - Nodes

> Identify the source and destination nodes. Group them by Internet data flows. Characterize them and provide assessment.


We can use the analysis 

## Task 2 - Protocols

> Set *L4* protocol interfaces (*UDP*/*TCP* ports), prevailing the *L1*, *L2*, *L3*, *L4* protocols. Present the obtained results in percentage terms. Determine the hierarchical statistics of the OSI levels. The obtained data must be presented in the form of tables and summarized in detail.

## Task 3 - Protocol overhead

> Set header and payload lengths in numerical (bit) and time axes. Link the received data with each other, and evaluate redundant information and its impact on the overall Internet ow. The obtained results must be presented in the form of tables and graphs, summarizing them.

## Task 4 - QoS parameters

> Set and analyze QoS parameters (TOS, Di Serv, ...). Determine the deviation of sending, receiving, and delaying individual traffic c components in a packet. Use mathematical and statistical means to estimate the minimums and maximums and deviations of these characteristics. Summarize the obtained results.

## Task 5 - Flow rates

> Determine the rate of individual ow components and the total ow rate. To evaluate speed minimum, maximum and deviations by mathematical and statistical means. Summarize the obtained results.

## Task 6 - Conclusion

> Provide summarized conclusions of whole practical work.
