Hello




####### Slide 1: What is IA?

First, a little intro before discussing the case itself. What is the internet archive?

They are are an American non-profit organisation (funded by donations, grants and by providing archiving services to partners)
doing what their name says: archiving the internet,
building and preserving a digital library of cultural artifacts and knowledge.

They provide the archived information to the general public.
It's useful for researchers, historians, scholars, and you!

Have you ever visited a website saved in your bookmarks only to see it being gone?
There is a very high chance of it being archived by the Internet archive.

They started archiving the internet in 1996 and now have over 29 years of web history
all accessible by the public. Totalling over 175 Petabytes (179200 Terabytes) (You can scan the qr code to access it)

Anyone can upload media to the internet archive. And they work with global partners (more than 1.2k)
to preserve their collections.





####### Slide 2: Books

They also run a book archiving service. Not everyone has access to a good public or academic library
and not everyone has the money to pay for access to a good one.

They started to digitize books in 2005 and scan more than 4k books daily.
Books published before 1929 are available for download,
and the rest - modern books, can be borrowed through their Open Library.

They are also designated depository for U.S. Government documents.







####### Slide 3: More about how Open Library works

The case I'm going to talk about concerns their Open Library lending service.
So here is how it works

Internet Archive maintains a one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio for the stored eBooks
It allows only as many 'lends' of a digital book as there are physical copies in its posession (They buy them).
Subsequently, Internet Archive expanded its Free Digital Library to include other libraries,
counting the number of physical copies of a book possessed by those libraries toward the total number
of digital copies it makes available at any given time.

You can't download books from the library, only lend them

This lending is called 'Controlled Digital Lending' or CDL





####### Slide 4: The case


In March 24 2020, during the pandemic Internet archive changed how the Open Library works

Instead of allowing one-to-one lending, they allowed unlimited number of users to lend the book,
but for a limited time.
They named this initiative "National Emergency Library" (NEL) and would run it until June 30 2020 or
until the US national emergency was over. At launch, the Internet Archive allowed authors
to submit opt-out requests for their works to be omitted from the National Emergency Library.


2 months after they did that, four book publishers sued Internet Archive,
saying that their library infringes copyright. 2 weeks after that, The national Emergency library was shut down.


You can see the whole timeline on the slide, and now I'm going to talk about each part separately.




####### Slide 5: Summary judgement


June 2022, both parties to the case requested summary judgment for the case, each favoring their respective sides
but no summary was issued, and instead, first hearing was held at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York


Summary judgment is a pretrial motion that promptly resolves legal actions where the
parties have no genuine issues with any material fact.
The court produces a judgment for one party against the opposing party without needing a full trial.




####### Slide 6: Publishers' point of view


Even though the lawsuit was triggered after the creation on NEL, the main topic
was not NEL, but rather the lending process itself. The NEL was also discussed, but in the context of
publishers' profit loss only.

From the publishers point of view, CDL was was illegal and not protected by the
doctrine of fair use. They also argued that Internet archive was not fully abiding by the CDL,
because sometimes, their partner libraries were not removing physical copies of books from their shelves
when the book was lent in the Open Library.

And for the emergency library, they argued that it harmed their revenue.




####### Slide 7: Internet archive point of view


They argued that CDL is fair use and that the publishers'
market was not impacted by their library



####### Slide 8: The press conference



Before oral arguments, Internet Archive held a press conference discussing the matter
The presenters agreed that book publishers need to make money to pay their expenses including authors.
The question is whether the National Emergency Library (NEL) actually harmed the publishers.


Lila Bailey, Senior Policy Counsel for the Internet Archive,[22] noted that:

    In the past, publishers stood against microfilm and photocopiers, crying harm. It took years, but eventually,
    the law affirmed each of these things, and the public benefitted.

    With this lawsuit, publishers have repeated those same claims of massive harm from controlled digital lending.
    When asked under oath, their own executives admitted this.

    They even instructed their own 950 dollar per hour expert not to even try to measure economic harm.

    On the other hand, when we invited economists from Northeastern University and the University of
    Copenhagen to look at the sales and library lending data produced in this case,
    they came to a singular conclusion: The Internet Archive's digital lending had no measurable effect on the market whatsoever.

Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig said that book publishers
need to make a profit to serve the public, but the material available to the public should not be limited to what commercial enterprises find profitable.
Netflix, for example, offers subscribers access to thousands of movies and television shows but routinely stops offering content for which the demand is too low.
That doesn't happen with libraries. Without controlled digital lending,
out-of-print books become essentially unavailable to the vast majority of humanity.

There were expert reports as well, saying that sales in the first five years after an edition's publication account for up to 90% of lifetime sales


####### Slide 9: First hearing, results



Judge John G. Koeltl ruled on March 24, 2023, granting the publishers' request.
He held that the Internet Archive's scanning and lending of complete copies constituted
copyright infringement and that the Internet Archive's fair use defense failed all four factors of the "fair use test".
He did not assess damages. Instead, he directed the parties to basically negotiate themselves.


Four factors:

    the purpose and character of your use
    the nature of the copyrighted work
    the amount and substantiality of the portion taken
    the effect of the use upon the potential market


####### Slide 10: The appeal


On September 11, 2023,
the Internet Archive filed an appeal notice to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
On December 15, 2023, the Internet Archive filed its opening brief in its appeal.
Shortly afterwards, several other organizations filed friend of the court briefs (Association of American Publishers)


friend of the court - is an individual or organization that is not a party to a case,
but that is permitted to assist a court with information, expertise, or insight connected with the issue.

In this case, it was AAP (Association of American Publishers), national trade association of the American book publishing industry
includes most of the major commercial publishers.


####### Slide 11: The appeal, results


On September 4, 2024, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court rulings.
The court stated "On the one hand, eBook licensing fees may impose a burden on libraries and reduce access to creative work.
On the other hand, authors have a right to be compensated in connection with the copying and distribution of their original creations."


Which is wrong, because it's not copying and distribution, it's lending, but
Internet archive did not petition to have this reviewed by the Supreme Court

so their decision was the final decision.



####### Slide 12: The outcome


As a result of the lawsuit, Internet Archive can't loan the books
published by the aforementioned publishers in full through their CDL program.
Which resulted in over half a million books beeing no longer available including more than 1.3k
books banned in some countries, so not available through mainstream publishers.

Also, Internet Archive had to pay an undisclosed amount to the publishers in monetary damages.


####### Slide 13: Similar cases / precedents

-- February 2005 - Users started archiving digital copies of 'Nintendo power', Nintendo's official magazine
for their games and products which ran from 1988 to 2012.
The first 140 issues had been collected, then Nintendo had the archive removed on August 8, 2016.

"[Nintendo] must protect our own characters, trademarks and other content.
The unapproved use of Nintendo's intellectual property can weaken our ability
to protect and preserve it, or to possibly use it for new projects"

Typical corporate law babble.

-- August 2017
Internet Archive was blocked in India because of "Piracy" because 2 blocked films were stored theme


-- August 2023
Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music
sued the Internet Archive over its 'Great 78' Project, saying that the project was engaged in copyright infringement.
The Great 78 Project stores digitized versions of pre-1972 songs and albums from 78-rpm phonograph records.

Dropped in September 15, 2025, parties reached undisclosed consensus




####### Slide 14: My opinion


I disagree with the the decision about the lending part.

And for the NEL, while maybe not completely right legally,
It was the right thing to do morally during the pandemic.
Publishers increased their prices during the pandemic as well,
which was a stupid thing to do.
And the whole Open Library concept is a great idea.
Just like physical libraries, but online.

In physical libraries, they buy books and lend them to people. So why can't the same
be done in the digital world?

If not for it, you would be stuck between buying overpriced licences to books
that can be altered by the publisher at any moment, or even removed when deemed not profitable of
banned by the government and between pirating the same books.

So from a personal point a view, not related to the case.
If you can't buy a real book on mainstream services, why even bother.
Don't feed the machine, buy books directly from authors!
This way they have more profit skipping both the publishers' and the distributors fee of about 60% in total.
and you have an actual e-book, not just a licence.




####### Slide 15: Why I chose this case. Conclusions

Cases like this show how greedy people are.

In the whole case 'we lost profits' was focused on the publishers,
very few authors objected the CDL.

While controlled fair lending of eBooks is not fine and not fair use,
but training AI on the same books without paying a cent to the authors, without an option to opt-out
and taking all the profits is fine and 'fair use'.
And the same preservation efforts by google and HathiTrust started in 2014 is also fair use.
