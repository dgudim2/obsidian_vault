- Topic/problem/research field analyzed

The problem of data inconsistency in large-scale IOT monitoring systems.

2. What are the solutions/methods was proposed for solving the determined issue?

Data recovery approach based on spatial-temporal (ST) correlation between the IoT nodes in the network.

3. What are results achieved by authors?

The proposed approach is more affective than existing ones.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-HLSTM in terms of mean absolute deviation, mean squared deviation, and data reliability.

4. What are limitations of the proposed solution, possible improvements and suggestions provided by you?

The proposed model takes higher training time compared to existing data recovery models.
And the smaller models work on short-term data only.

Suggestions:
Try to find a model architecture that is comparatively easy/fast to train while still providing reasonable accuracy.
