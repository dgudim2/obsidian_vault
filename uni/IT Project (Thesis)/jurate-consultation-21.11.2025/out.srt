1
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,560
Kloud:

2
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:40,100
Jurate: okay hello hello right okay I plan to show you I need the latest file.

3
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,840
Jurate: which one is your latest file?

4
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,880
Kloud: once again sorry you can call the next cloud and grab it but I can send it to you as a PDF or something.

5
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
Jurate: yeah and immediately as a PDF.

6
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,420
Jurate: it will be one moment and now I'm unable to find in a fast mode.

7
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:13,860
Jurate: just it will be quicker if you would send and I will tell you what has to be done in next steps and I will give you you know like samples of other bachelor thesis and I will send you print screens on what you need to do.

8
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,480
Kloud: yeah okay we have examples but they're like from 2007 or something.

9
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Jurate: I have fresher ones even if they're in Lithuania.

10
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,440
Jurate: you will see the structure I do also have in English as well.

11
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,180
Jurate: it's just that I cannot give them to you due to privacy.

12
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,420
Jurate: yeah right yeah I just can't.

13
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,760
Jurate: I can.

14
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,640
Jurate: I can give you snapshots of it but I can't you give it whole?

15
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:55,820
Jurate: I mean yeah probably you will not share it but but still okay let me then share everything that I that I have.

16
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,760
Jurate: let's go with screens let's go live.

17
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:11,460
Jurate: okay right so I will send you a feedback regarding introduction because I have it on my iPad.

18
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,340
Jurate: so what will we?

19
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,460
Jurate: what do you do?

20
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:25,980
Jurate: usually in introductions we don't use these you know like bullet points because this is more of a requirements.

21
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,840
Jurate: okay so you can omit these like in general.

22
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,280
Jurate: we need to access this and this.

23
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,400
Kloud: so do I just omit or do I integrate them into like a normal flow of the text?

24
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,860
Jurate: it would be.

25
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,380
Jurate: it would be as a normal flow would be better not bullet list.

26
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Jurate: okay you know like what should be done etc.

27
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:43,720
Jurate: etc.

28
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Jurate: etc.

29
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,920
Jurate: problem of the feces okay objectives more like aim of the feces.

30
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,460
Jurate: but I will send you the feedback.

31
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,860
Jurate: you don't have to do anything now.

32
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,700
Jurate: it's just like aim of the feces.

33
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Kloud: it was in the template.

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,100
Kloud: I just copied it.

35
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,880
Jurate: yeah yeah but it's better to like aim and then we have either objectives or tasks.

36
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,500
Jurate: it would be better okay formulate it like this and this is enough like this.

37
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,680
Jurate: okay your objective.

38
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,060
Jurate: okay aim that that's it.

39
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,620
Jurate: you don't have to write it in two sentences is usually one.

40
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,940
Jurate: what I'm trying to do and why am I doing this?

41
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,400
Jurate: this one is good dynamical and auxiliary features and features and integrations.

42
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,840
Jurate: omit this completely because first is like you're analyzing existing solutions for that.

43
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,860
Jurate: okay yeah yeah like various websites mobile apps etc.

44
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,260
Jurate: etc.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Jurate: your second task should be technology web technology analyze existing technologies used for web development.

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,900
Jurate: it's more like okay but you are developing your.

47
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,540
Kloud: it's not well it's like app so it's like for cross platform development.

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,680
Jurate: then yeah I'm just giving an example like if let's say it would be a web app.

49
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Jurate: so I need to specify if it's a cross-platform application.

50
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:26,600
Jurate: then you need to analyze technologies because this second chapter is to prove that the technology stack that you have decided to work with and that it's plausible mm-hmm even though you already are working.

51
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:35,260
Jurate: I mean it's a little bit of cheating I call it but you still need to show that you at least know other existing alternatives.

52
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,100
Jurate: yeah you still need to demonstrate that you did analysis because you did.

53
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,340
Jurate: I mean it just.

54
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,820
Jurate: it's not just described.

55
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,340
Jurate: yeah so that so that you would not have this argument as I've heard some students say.

56
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,640
Jurate: why did you choose Spring Boot?

57
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:09,980
Jurate: because I know Java and I like Java and it was easier and the committee was like oh come on can you at least make something on the spot that is not so lame basically like this.

58
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,800
Jurate: so you need the second chapter now your determined core and auxiliary features and design a cross-platform application.

59
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,300
Jurate: it's exactly the same.

60
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,380
Jurate: so you just keep the third one.

61
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:33,480
Jurate: just design and develop because when you are designing you're already determining based on the previous analysis what should be in your developed system.

62
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,420
Jurate: so this design design.

63
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:45,740
Jurate: you can actually have this design across platform which is going to be 2 plus 3 your current second and third in the world.

64
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:54,000
Jurate: and yeah and then develop yeah then this one is going to develop and test the solution.

65
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,180
Jurate: okay now these implement changes in the location of the feedback.

66
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,820
Jurate: you can do it.

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,140
Jurate: you can have this fifth task which is improvements.

68
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Jurate: that one keep it but this is not necessary.

69
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,700
Jurate: gather feedback from real users.

70
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:21,260
Jurate: this is going to be your final one gather the feedback and improve the proposed solution the developed solution or something like this.

71
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:30,200
Jurate: so you will have two tasks that are from theory existing solutions and technology analysis.

72
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:49,800
Jurate: then your first the third task is going to be like modeling designing that system the set system fourth is going to be developed and test and your task number five is going to be get feedback and improve based on on that feedback like this.

73
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:58,260
Kloud: and one question I have with the task as well do the topics at the bottom like further down have to match those exactly.

74
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,880
Kloud: or is it just like an overview and the topics will can be a bit different?

75
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,560
Jurate: what do you mean top top topics what topics you mean?

76
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,760
Kloud: I mean the chapters chapters.

77
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,780
Jurate: yeah yeah yes they have to.

78
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:19,940
Jurate: they have to answer these tasks but the type the naming is going to be different.

79
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,700
Jurate: okay for example if you're analyzing existing solutions you know like from other universities evaluate their feature set it's okay.

80
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,280
Jurate: so your one first big chapter is going to be for task one and for task number two.

81
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,320
Jurate: so your chapter one is going to be like how to covering to two tasks.

82
00:09:41,580 --> 00:10:01,860
Jurate: okay yeah first chapter is going to have some kind of a title that encompasses both of these such as I'm improvising okay like campus management solutions and cross-platform development something like this.

83
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:19,340
Jurate: and then your chapter one point one is going to be campus existing campus management systems and one point one one is going to be option one one one two is going to be option two etc.

84
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:19,760
Jurate: etc.

85
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:45,020
Jurate: then you will have one point two chapter which is going to be cross-platform development technologies and then you will have one two one let's say front end one two two is going to be let's say back end one two three like server side solution solution something like this.

86
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,660
Jurate: maybe one two four is going to be database something like this.

87
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:05,200
Jurate: okay understood yeah so it's going to be like this and your whole chapter one answers everything that is related to theory and basically one point one will answer your first question and one point two will answer your second question.

88
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,540
Jurate: right so if I'm going to scroll this one is good work area.

89
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:18,400
Jurate: you don't even have to write this one you can just have it as a you know introductory one or two pages something like this.

90
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,920
Jurate: not necessarily this is too short I would actually say because working area is usually one to two pages.

91
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,980
Kloud: okay so this is less than one page and this also mirrors the the things I've wrote in the previous chapters a bit.

92
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,900
Kloud: so I'm not sure if this is okay.

93
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,760
Jurate: yeah so basically what you're doing?

94
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,440
Jurate: you are describing what is in going to be in the following chapters.

95
00:11:47,320 --> 00:12:09,660
Jurate: you can expect this working area by including references to scientific papers and whereas statistical data how I would imagine you could add more information to this one the basically to this not paragraph not in a chapter.

96
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,580
Jurate: this is like intro.

97
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:27,300
Jurate: introductory text is by starting like from a very far point of view like giving an overall idea such as worldwide.

98
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:43,600
Jurate: basically universities accept students from all the countries okay and this results in the fact that depending on the country people come with certain expectations and certain practices.

99
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:54,560
Jurate: okay let's say if I go to United States I will probably dislike the system because in my opinion it's too lax and maybe not structured enough.

100
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:13,320
Jurate: okay those who come from example from Nigeria what we have in our university is a hardcore like very strict and let's say a set of rules that we have and that is familiar to us.

101
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,520
Jurate: it's not familiar to students and then they get lost.

102
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,880
Jurate: okay like when to attend lectures how to organize work multiple systems.

103
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:37,000
Jurate: basically this results in a confusion okay and in the fact that maybe time and information is not managed efficiently for the student.

104
00:13:37,380 --> 00:14:03,260
Jurate: okay so this is your introductory area and this is why it's important to have this universal like system that you are trying to develop but basically the need for such systems which are easy to access which are intuitive which are clear and that they work efficiently with whatever is provided in that university.

105
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,900
Jurate: that's why it's important.

106
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,160
Jurate: this is your work area.

107
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,680
Jurate: okay like like this.

108
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,220
Kloud: okay so I start from that.

109
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,200
Kloud: do I continue like I continued like I wrote here.

110
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:22,820
Jurate: I will probably slightly minimize the text like in less detail but you will keep part of this text for sure.

111
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:29,280
Jurate: okay and then you will continue like in the following chapters.

112
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,780
Jurate: you usually you'd never say that you never talk in the first person.

113
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,340
Jurate: so it's going to be like following chapters analyze the mentioned systems their pros and cons.

114
00:14:43,680 --> 00:15:02,060
Jurate: okay then technology stack analysis is going to be presented in chapter 1.2 something like this like you have this intro the structure and then you continue working basically defining or reviewing similar systems like official Moodle app.

115
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,760
Jurate: yeah with print screens old Vilnius mobile app etc.

116
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,140
Jurate: etc.

117
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Jurate: so what is important?

118
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,580
Kloud: yeah how exactly do I like structure those parts?

119
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,600
Jurate: okay I can.

120
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,820
Jurate: I can actually show you a an example of existing bachelor thesis.

121
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,080
Jurate: I mean what you did.

122
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,120
Jurate: very good I mean this is what you're going to analyze now.

123
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,520
Jurate: you need to just need to structure it.

124
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,160
Jurate: so okay an example on how to do this.

125
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Jurate: let me quickly show you.

126
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,160
Jurate: okay for example this is like two years ago.

127
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,380
Jurate: this is a student's work again.

128
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Jurate: he was also from English speaking group.

129
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,820
Jurate: I can show you the way he structures.

130
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,780
Jurate: so what he did?

131
00:15:50,900 --> 00:16:03,160
Jurate: he developed a dormitory management mobile app because as a foreign student he got annoyed like how the hell am I supposed to know where to live?

132
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,180
Jurate: should I go to Arroyo de Salte?

133
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,100
Jurate: inconvenient expensive if I live in a dormitory I need to write to administrators.

134
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,060
Jurate: administrators maybe they will write you back maybe not.

135
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,860
Jurate: payment system is like manual pretty much you pay then you send the payment confirmation.

136
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,940
Jurate: inconvenient.

137
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,120
Jurate: so what he wanted?

138
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,880
Jurate: he wanted to develop an Android app like a prototype mm-hmm.

139
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,820
Jurate: so so this is the relevance.

140
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,880
Jurate: let's go.

141
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,180
Jurate: so this is the introduction.

142
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,360
Jurate: yeah like for example his first chapter is like accommodation management and it's the and its importance.

143
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:53,580
Jurate: and here we have accommodation reservation systems and let's say it's booking.com because this is what works for students as well.

144
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,360
Jurate: and he begins describing like what is booking how popular it is and what it offers.

145
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,100
Jurate: okay and then he goes like with print screen.

146
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,380
Jurate: so if you're defining some kind of like what it offers you need to add.

147
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Jurate: I recommend to adding print screens with main functions.

148
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,060
Jurate: okay.

149
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:26,800
Jurate: so if you let's say you're analyzing some kind of web app and it's like a huge chunky page you don't have to add like front front page print screen because it's pointless.

150
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,620
Jurate: yeah but what you can do?

151
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:38,840
Jurate: you can print screen certain areas with certain functionality that you think is very good for example that is relevant to the thing?

152
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:46,140
Jurate: yeah not not not all but like several relevant and all the others are going to be provided in the text.

153
00:17:46,620 --> 00:18:04,200
Jurate: so over here what he did is like you know super convenient short info like a picture that lies and then a description a picture that lies and then a description and I how to view information because he thinks this is cool because he wanted to do something similar like an overview.

154
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,400
Jurate: then I'm choosing a dormitory then I'm choosing the room and then what should I do with payment something like this.

155
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,480
Jurate: and then he provides like a functionality what it offers.

156
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,920
Jurate: I think this is not the final version.

157
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,720
Jurate: so you provide what is good and then you write down for example maybe things that it's lacking.

158
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:33,300
Jurate: then he goes for Airbnb exactly the same like short description what it does like an overall and then he goes into details and again how how it's structured what is important?

159
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,480
Kloud: okay and what are those?

160
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,360
Kloud: what are those references like six and five to what?

161
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,740
Jurate: to the web page to the web page the bottom to the website.

162
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:53,180
Jurate: understood yes yes yes yes and in the references in these sources that you have I'm going to scroll down for example here reference six like access.

163
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,940
Jurate: one is accessed online etc.

164
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,340
Jurate: just like a source because it's not it's not your print screen it's not your developed system.

165
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,260
Jurate: so all these things websites they're going to be as a reference.

166
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,760
Jurate: the same with Airbnb and for example what is good?

167
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,400
Jurate: and then we have despite being globally available it has some issues and he writes them down.

168
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Jurate: then we have our what the Sultan again how to find something something and again compared to others what it has what it doesn't have and so on.

169
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,300
Jurate: and then we have universities official web page mm-hmm.

170
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,560
Jurate: so it's fitting that he added a web page because it doesn't have anything.

171
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,760
Jurate: it's like a proof here.

172
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,240
Jurate: yeah there's a there's an email.

173
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,060
Jurate: that's it fail.

174
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,700
Jurate: I mean we have a chatbot.

175
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
Jurate: it doesn't help me.

176
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,340
Jurate: something like that.

177
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,560
Jurate: okay and the same with Vilnius University something like this.

178
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,800
Jurate: that's it.

179
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,140
Jurate: this is how you struck.

180
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Jurate: okay like okay begin start describing what the task.

181
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,920
Jurate: insert some kind of print screens with in your case in relevant useful for example features.

182
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,140
Jurate: then you continue the describing the text.

183
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,940
Jurate: why is it formatted in this way?

184
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,680
Jurate: it's just that all your images must be mentioned in the text first.

185
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,060
Jurate: so it goes like this you start describing.

186
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:26,540
Jurate: then you say for example this app has these these decent features as shown in figure why ABC etc.

187
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,780
Jurate: insert pictures and then you continue describing like this.

188
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,200
Jurate: and then pros cons and etc.

189
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,240
Jurate: then 1.2 chapter as I've said because you need to have technology overview.

190
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,700
Jurate: so he was working with.

191
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,300
Jurate: his bachelor thesis was was about Android app development.

192
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,820
Jurate: so what he did?

193
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,680
Jurate: he started like fundamentals of app development.

194
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:06,760
Jurate: you might argue maybe these are like basic stuff but as bachelor great students you don't have to begin immediately you know with scientific paper review.

195
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,900
Jurate: it's okay if you give this broader of overview like how mobile apps that are developed in general.

196
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:24,880
Jurate: so he specifies you know like what are the approaches and then he chooses like one approach that he will work with something like this.

197
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,160
Jurate: but the analysis is done this application cycle not necessary.

198
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,240
Jurate: but what he does?

199
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:40,500
Jurate: he goes with Android then he analyzes Apple iOS in his case and then he goes Kotlin yeah Kotlin.

200
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,380
Jurate: then he not compared with Java and something like this.

201
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,780
Jurate: then he goes for requirement specification.

202
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:58,740
Jurate: in my opinion this section could have been broader and this is where I will show you a Lithuanian work because in my opinion it's better to have more things.

203
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,720
Jurate: so what the student did here?

204
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,400
Jurate: he developed a web platform.

205
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,720
Jurate: okay and he was interested in learning methods for students in school.

206
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,540
Jurate: so what he did?

207
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:35,160
Jurate: he provided because this he already had his own like learning system what he wanted to implement he wanted to implement like how to prepare for tests exams using a certain card methods like it's from pedagogy car from that area.

208
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,340
Jurate: so he wanted to apply and digitalize this idea.

209
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,960
Jurate: so again what he did?

210
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,020
Jurate: I mean don't don't don't worry if it's an if it's on Lithuanian the structure is the same.

211
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,380
Jurate: so he has these learning platforms which are using interval flashcards.

212
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,660
Kloud: yeah I know I use them.

213
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,160
Jurate: yeah yeah.

214
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:04,660
Jurate: so he goes with okay yes how it does it what it has and then we have these prevalent which is pros.

215
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
Jurate: then he has these cons like this done.

216
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:22,280
Jurate: then he goes and analyzes quizlet okay okay the same situation yes same it's important to maintain the same structure study go exactly the same memorize exactly the same.

217
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,100
Jurate: so you already understand this section is clear.

218
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,520
Jurate: yeah this one is not necessary because he was from a program engineering course.

219
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,900
Jurate: so they are required to have this additional criteria table.

220
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,240
Jurate: so you can skip on this one.

221
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,180
Jurate: this is all you need a comparison table something.

222
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:49,040
Jurate: okay yeah it's like a comparison table based on the criteria that he deems useful.

223
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,440
Jurate: you can do it but it's not necessary for you.

224
00:23:51,560 --> 00:24:18,700
Jurate: okay then we have a web system development technologies and he goes one the first one server side programming languages and he describes like PHP JavaScript Python Java because he's choosing among them and that's it like short with references what they offer how they're good and then he provides like a short description based on the analysis.

225
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,980
Jurate: I decided to choose PHP because and that's it provide argumentation.

226
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,460
Jurate: then we have web frameworks frameworks.

227
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,720
Jurate: yeah web frameworks and again frameworks etc.

228
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,080
Jurate: etc.

229
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:32,460
Jurate: etc.

230
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,240
Jurate: no car get no framework.

231
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,540
Jurate: and again based on this analysis it was decided to do this and this.

232
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:52,780
Jurate: then we have UI frameworks so these are front-end okay basically and again Laravel a page render not sure if that's how in English.

233
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Jurate: then we have angular view JS and again based on analysis I chose this.

234
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:07,120
Jurate: and then we have relational databases and again what databases he decided to analyze analysis and what was chosen.

235
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,700
Jurate: that's it?

236
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,320
Kloud: okay yeah that's it.

237
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,620
Kloud: I think I was kind of the same structure.

238
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,360
Kloud: this make no sense.

239
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:23,440
Jurate: yeah you because it's it's clear it's clean and actually provides your ability to you know gather and describe data.

240
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,920
Jurate: another thing that students are recommended to do and that they sometimes do.

241
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,680
Jurate: let me quickly open another students work it's this year students.

242
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,340
Jurate: again he is developing a tutor system.

243
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,820
Jurate: it's like his own business.

244
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:55,300
Jurate: he's tutoring and he's not satisfied with lesson management and the calendar and he's implementing you know certain backend solutions for his own like business.

245
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,220
Jurate: so what he does?

246
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,960
Jurate: yeah he's.

247
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,500
Jurate: he says basically I already have you know like tutors I'm also a tutor.

248
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,640
Jurate: I already have some kind of system.

249
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,360
Jurate: oh but it's not enough anymore because the business grew.

250
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,700
Jurate: so again he analyzes existing tutoring platforms.

251
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,960
Jurate: what functionalities do they offer so that he would understand what he wants to have in his own system.

252
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,400
Jurate: scroll scroll scroll what you can do.

253
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,780
Jurate: you can add comparative tables.

254
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:44,060
Jurate: for example here we have existing tutor tutoring system comparison where basically he says functionality property and then first second and third like candidates that he analyzed.

255
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,420
Jurate: and then he says for example lesson type individual group individual so that he would.

256
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,800
Jurate: basically he's systemizing the data.

257
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,280
Jurate: then we have like disciplines.

258
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,920
Jurate: how many subjects like only math eight disciplines more than 50 disciplines.

259
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:18,440
Jurate: account creation only administrator only administrator individual registration like as a user I can create it I don't have to contact you know that tutor those tutors so that they would create an account and basically what he did.

260
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:28,000
Jurate: he already decided on what features he would like to have and then describes what others are offering.

261
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,160
Jurate: so you can have something like this.

262
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,520
Kloud: so like the previous example but instead of the key are whatever.

263
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,480
Kloud: what was there on the left actual features on the left?

264
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,000
Jurate: I see yeah yeah something like this.

265
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,340
Jurate: you can you can have it.

266
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:56,560
Jurate: yes yes instead of this some students also do like for example he describes in here others do for example multiple lessons and then he has plus minus plus minus.

267
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Jurate: you can also do it like in this manner.

268
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,740
Jurate: it's just that you don't have to have additional table with requirement one and then other table requirement one plus minus plus minus.

269
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,820
Jurate: you can have one table.

270
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,400
Jurate: yeah okay something like this.

271
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:21,040
Jurate: then he analyzes technologies technologies and then again you he provides technology overview.

272
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,520
Jurate: yeah comparison it's like where to use pros and cons like a summary table.

273
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:34,840
Jurate: you can also have this one not necessary but you can have if you think that it's it's better and it brings in clarity.

274
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,840
Kloud: something like this it will increase page count.

275
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,220
Jurate: yeah yes my god your priorities.

276
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,940
Jurate: but yeah yes yes how to generate pages at print screens and tables.

277
00:28:47,060 --> 00:29:09,140
Jurate: yes but again don't don't expand too much because your literature analysis only literature when you start counting from chapter number one it should not exceed more than 20 pages because your bachelor thesis is up to 65 pages can be maybe 70 pages but no more.

278
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,540
Jurate: okay it doesn't have to be too long right?

279
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:25,020
Jurate: so when you are done with this you will go to chapter number two which is your system already design specification.

280
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,360
Jurate: you will definitely begin with a use case diagram what is your system and what your system allows to do?

281
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,280
Jurate: so you will have a use case with a table like like this.

282
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:47,960
Jurate: one main tasks because you will need to define functional requirements and functional requirements are mapped to use case.

283
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,260
Kloud: yeah okay yeah.

284
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:07,680
Jurate: so if you have some kind of use case such as for example based on let's say users can view their upcoming homeworks you know immediate integration from model just an example right?

285
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,080
Jurate: yeah.

286
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:25,760
Jurate: so in order to implement this feature this one use case it is entirely possible that you will have for example five functional requirements that you need to implement that are going to be mapped to exactly the same use case.

287
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,380
Jurate: I mean for this to work I need to do this this this and this like that.

288
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,880
Jurate: that's why it's important to have numbers and description.

289
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,540
Jurate: okay then you will have not necessary to have this flow diagram.

290
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:50,420
Jurate: what you will have you will have after that sequence diagrams basically sequence diagram so that you would explain how your use case is going to work.

291
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,840
Kloud: so you will have so here user why why?

292
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,760
Kloud: then maybe model API and then whatever?

293
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,380
Jurate: okay yeah so explain this is a simplified version.

294
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,580
Jurate: when you are going to work you are going to work with hold on hold on.

295
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,940
Jurate: this one is advanced level because we have a sub use cases.

296
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:27,980
Jurate: yeah sequence diagrams should be like this okay where you consider alternative and optional functionality if there is any okay so alternatives are going to be.

297
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:35,800
Jurate: for example you send the data and something fails so you will have site success route and fail route.

298
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,920
Jurate: so you need to add them into these diagrams to simplify.

299
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:51,380
Jurate: basically if you have five use cases you usually you have five sequence diagrams explaining each use case.

300
00:31:52,140 --> 00:32:05,600
Jurate: if your use case is not complicated for example login and registration you can combine them into one diagram and show how login works and in the same diagram after that how registration works.

301
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:13,060
Jurate: okay like this okay yeah you can combine these and basically you will have description diagram description diagram.

302
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:25,680
Jurate: let's scroll down a little bit more like this this this this this oh Jesus Christ I need to stop this person already.

303
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,040
Jurate: this is already too much.

304
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,360
Jurate: yeah yeah.

305
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,440
Jurate: and then here you have.

306
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:50,240
Jurate: you will have a table with functional requirements like requirement description priority use case and dependencies because it's entirely possible that your functional requirements are going to be connected to other requirements such as this requirement is not going to be implemented if my other requirement is not implemented.

307
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
Jurate: oh you know they're connected.

308
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Kloud: yeah okay so like this.

309
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,660
Jurate: so you will have functional requirements and then you will have non-functional requirements.

310
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,980
Jurate: so basically you will have one table of non-functional requirements.

311
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,860
Jurate: you don't have to provide details like priorities and severity and other stuff.

312
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:22,980
Jurate: they basically you will have a number description and the type for example reliability scalability development environment and etc.

313
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,880
Jurate: like this.

314
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,380
Kloud: so in my case I don't have a background.

315
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,060
Kloud: so no reliability or whatever requirement use.

316
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Kloud: how do I say it?

317
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Kloud: ease of use or something.

318
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,200
Kloud: can this be not functional?

319
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,960
Jurate: can you give me an example?

320
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,380
Jurate: I mean these requirements function non-functional requirements.

321
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
Jurate: there's actually a list.

322
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,580
Jurate: you don't have to include all of them.

323
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,260
Jurate: okay yeah it's based on what you need because usually non-functional requirements.

324
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,540
Jurate: there is actually a list.

325
00:33:59,680 --> 00:33:59,860
Jurate: I can.

326
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,020
Jurate: I can find you these non-functional requirements.

327
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,460
Jurate: you will basically go through the list you will have examples and you will see.

328
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,699
Jurate: yeah I can apply this.

329
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,600
Jurate: no I cannot.

330
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,540
Kloud: oh there is a little.

331
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,040
Jurate: okay yeah yes there's a list.

332
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,000
Jurate: yes yes yes.

333
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:33,840
Jurate: for example let's say one of your requirements which is going to be I think it's compatibility for example that your developed system is going to work on let's say Chrome or Edge and Safari some kind of versions.

334
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:47,679
Jurate: okay if you would develop some kind of computer game you could say that this system works on Linux works on Windows and that's it and I'm not going to be bothered that it works on Mac as well.

335
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,100
Jurate: so these are non-functional requirements.

336
00:34:50,340 --> 00:35:10,880
Jurate: okay yeah yeah yeah just like this for example in your case for example that your system is reliable and works 98 percent of the time and if some kind of crash happens that your system is going to be up and running within the given timeframe something like this.

337
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,840
Jurate: okay it's not necessary to add this.

338
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:22,420
Jurate: or for example that your system supports I don't know 1,000 users at the same time and it doesn't crash.

339
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,080
Jurate: something like this.

340
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,620
Kloud: yeah because my system would depend on the university's back and so this is basically requirements for the universities back end.

341
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,340
Jurate: yeah yeah yeah so basically universities back.

342
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,220
Jurate: so so in this case you don't even need to write this because this is not of your not your problem.

343
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,980
Jurate: okay not an issue something like this okay.

344
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,820
Jurate: so at this time you don't have to write neither functional nor non-functional requirements.

345
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,800
Jurate: basically what you need to do?

346
00:35:50,200 --> 00:36:01,320
Jurate: you need to structure your analytical part first and try to create your use case.

347
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,820
Jurate: these are the steps that you need to take now.

348
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,340
Kloud: yeah okay understood is it?

349
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,600
Jurate: is it clearer now?

350
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,600
Kloud: yeah that's clear that's yeah yeah.

351
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:20,420
Jurate: so try this and again I will grab from the system your your your file.

352
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,960
Jurate: I imagine that you can improve.

353
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,400
Jurate: so far don't do anything with with introduction.

354
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,720
Jurate: concentrate on your chapter number one and try to answer these questions.

355
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:54,380
Jurate: well basically what we discussed now and I imagine that until next Friday you can provide like a draft version I mean draft not complete complete draft but like already structured version with not necessarily a beautiful text.

356
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,640
Jurate: but you can provide this until the next Friday.

357
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,580
Jurate: yeah that's chapter number one.

358
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
Jurate: and then you will begin with chapter number two.

359
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:18,020
Jurate: so if it's going to be 21st until 28th if we have yeah until 28th then you will begin your requirements.

360
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,660
Jurate: so until December number five you will have a draft version of your second chapter.

361
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:37,080
Jurate: then you will polish until December 12 your second chapter and then until 19th you will beautify both chapter one introduction and chapter number two.

362
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:46,460
Kloud: okay okay we have a bit different deadlines from our it's my understanding.

363
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,400
Jurate: what I want is just until 19th.

364
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,620
Jurate: I would like you to have the structure for chapter one and number two.

365
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,600
Jurate: okay it's not necessarily going to be beautiful.

366
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:05,900
Jurate: I know that you have your own timetable suggests that I'm asking you to do this until 19th so that you would go to holidays and not be bothered.

367
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:11,240
Jurate: okay because your BD1 is mainly from your chapter number one.

368
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,660
Jurate: but if you have already chapter number two even if it's not complete it's a huge plus.

369
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,300
Jurate: you will definitely get an approval.

370
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,320
Jurate: yeah I mean when it's going to be BD1 your your work has to be beautiful.

371
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,340
Jurate: whatever you present.

372
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,840
Jurate: it has to be like a final version already.

373
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,280
Jurate: nice beautiful text normal formatting all the references and etc.

374
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,360
Jurate: okay yeah I know that you have different timetables.

375
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,060
Kloud: they're shorter.

376
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,320
Kloud: they're like before before the December.

377
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,160
Kloud: I think we have to provide one moment mm-hmm.

378
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,080
Kloud: let me go into the mood and hope it doesn't ask me to log in.

379
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,180
Kloud: it will definitely ask me to log in.

380
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,840
Jurate: I know the same for me.

381
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:11,560
Jurate: even although I logged in not so long ago I still need to log in again because let's say I'm doing that from another computer which is bothersome.

382
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:30,020
Jurate: oh my god still it's less annoying than whatever Microsoft is doing.

383
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:37,060
Jurate: oh yeah okay yeah maybe it's it's less annoying although we do use my.

384
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:53,500
Jurate: we do use Microsoft though but but but still whatever Microsoft is doing there with at least at least the password that I enter in my work works because if it's a personal account you know there's a running joke.

385
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,360
Jurate: you know you entered your password.

386
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Jurate: password is incorrect.

387
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,620
Jurate: please change your password.

388
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,900
Jurate: yeah change the password.

389
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Jurate: password is incorrect.

390
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,800
Jurate: oh my goodness change the password.

391
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:11,280
Jurate: password cannot be the same as the password before although you have just entered this and then you just table flip and you say oh screw this.

392
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,300
Kloud: yeah.

393
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:24,980
Kloud: so here once theoretical part draft until November 27 he wants practical part draft until Thursday December 4th.

394
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:32,600
Kloud: so they're like you're saying I should complete the theory part until some.

395
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:40,340
Kloud: well for December what you said 13 of December yeah like like completely beautiful like full final version.

396
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:49,420
Jurate: I don't think you need to have this whole final version for your but I mean if if you're if you're if your subject requires.

397
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,120
Jurate: then yeah you do for the deadline for that deadline.

398
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
Jurate: but these deadlines are for me understood.

399
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,400
Kloud: this is this is what you want.

400
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,560
Jurate: but he wants that okay I see.

401
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:07,220
Kloud: hmm interested draft as I understand draft for him is like not beautiful.

402
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,160
Kloud: so just so.

403
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,360
Jurate: introduction draft.

404
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,440
Jurate: okay okay theoretical part draft.

405
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,540
Jurate: so you already presented this not presented.

406
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,380
Kloud: I just applauded.

407
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,620
Kloud: area and then some basic feedback.

408
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,640
Jurate: just some basic feedback.

409
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,040
Kloud: okay your feedback is better my feedback is better.

410
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,320
Kloud: yeah he gave something generic like let me see.

411
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,240
Jurate: well he does have a lot of students.

412
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:43,240
Kloud: oh yeah hey he said what the introduction should contain and that the thesis need to be provided in the past form.

413
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,260
Kloud: that's it okay.

414
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,460
Jurate: so yeah it is presented it is done.

415
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
Jurate: so these are like Jen general.

416
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,200
Jurate: yeah okay then you have practical part draft.

417
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,620
Jurate: so it's Wednesday 19th of November.

418
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,740
Jurate: so wait no it's due.

419
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,940
Kloud: yeah what also I don't understand.

420
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,160
Jurate: oh it's a draft oh my goodness.

421
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,440
Jurate: no no no it's okay you you look.

422
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,500
Jurate: okay it's 27th for the draft so it's very close to what I want.

423
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:21,540
Jurate: okay so fine until 27th beautify and add these all these things that I told you like.

424
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,820
Kloud: okay yeah I wanted to do it this weekend so should be okay.

425
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:34,060
Jurate: so yeah so if you have questions you can immediately ping me so that I could look at that work and I will immediately tell you what needs to be added.

426
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:42,360
Jurate: maybe okay so practical draft until December 4th still counts because you will also do that.

427
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,280
Jurate: okay it's just that until 27th try to prepare use case.

428
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,580
Jurate: okay mm-hmm include this.

429
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:59,460
Jurate: okay if these are the deadlines implementation draft is going to be Thursday 11th of December.

430
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,020
Jurate: so okay not too difficult not too difficult.

431
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,260
Jurate: he wants to do everything until December.

432
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,640
Jurate: he moved them see several times but it's a draft but it's a draft version and not the final.

433
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:29,480
Jurate: yes because with me you will have like a final version of chapter 1 and 2 will mostly final version until December 5 19th like before going to vacation you will do.

434
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,120
Jurate: you will do more than it's required over here for your homework tasks.

435
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,460
Jurate: mmm okay okay okay okay then complete until 27th.

436
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,860
Jurate: okay after this weekend basically concentrate on analysis and use case.

437
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,840
Jurate: okay yeah and then we will.

438
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,680
Jurate: we will contact again and you will start working on chapter number two.

439
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,140
Jurate: yeah if you want I can.

440
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,800
Jurate: I can send you print screens

441
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,700
Kloud: green screens yeah maybe yeah okay

442
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:17,100
Jurate: okay I can give you an example like how to you know tables summary tables how to organize use case plus what should be the table for those use cases and an example of sequence diagram so that you could get the basic idea.

443
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,220
Kloud: okay I have.

444
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,360
Kloud: okay yeah thanks.

445
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,960
Jurate: okay nice I have it.

446
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,780
Jurate: just I will.

447
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,500
Jurate: I will send these print screens in the evening.

448
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,140

449
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,340
Kloud: yeah that's fine with me.

450
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,180
Jurate: okay any more questions?

451
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,020
Kloud: yeah I have a question about the references.

452
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,240
Kloud: so do I have to include some kind of like there is?

453
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:47,780
Kloud: is there a minimum for the references I should do and do they have to be scientific or at least 20 references?

454
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,500
Jurate: okay that's what I require.

455
00:44:49,560 --> 00:45:02,720
Jurate: format from my students at least 20 references and if you're working with me so it's going to be five purely scientific papers and other ones are going to be books blogs documentation and websites.

456
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:10,540
Jurate: okay then yes concentrate on this at least five scientific papers.

457
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:20,260
Jurate: usually bachelor students are not required but all those who fall under my supervision they are required to do that.

458
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:30,980
Jurate: it's just because their work is going to be way more sophisticated and it demonstrates your ability to analyze but difficult material.

459
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,180
Jurate: yeah okay yeah so that's it.

460
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,700
Jurate: and then I will wait for your questions and you will wait for my print screens until the evening.
