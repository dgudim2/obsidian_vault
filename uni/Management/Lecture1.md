# What is Management?

* __Practical Management__
  * Professional activity
  * As an art: the idea of a combination of both scientific principles and creative problem-solving abilities
* __Management as a Science__
  * Management as a science can be understood as a branch of study focused on the management of organizations.

> [!note] 
> 
> - **Management** is both a *practical* activity and a *branch of science*. As a practical activity, management involves *leading and directing people and resources* in an organization to achieve specific goals. This aspect of management involves the application of practical skills and techniques, such as *planning*, *organizing*, *motivating*, and *controlling*, to achieve organizational objectives. On the other hand, management is also a branch of science that involves the *systematic study and analysis* of the principles, theories, and practices of organizational leadership and management.
> 
> - **Management** can be defined as a field of study that focuses on *how to effectively manage organizations*. The knowledge base of management theory includes various concepts and theoretical frameworks that are related to other fields of science, such as *mathematics*, *statistics*, *economics*, *psychology*, *anthropology*, and more. However, there are also specific terms that are unique to the field of management.
> 
> - Different management theories and concepts are developed through *ongoing observations of real-world organizational* management practices. The practical experience of managers provides valuable insights and feedback for the development of management theory, while the scientific study of management helps to inform the practical application of management techniques and practices. The interplay between these two aspects of management is what makes it a dynamic and constantly evolving field.
> 
> - In the realm of practical management, managerial skills and qualifications are of paramount importance. It is not sufficient for a manager to possess solely the necessary knowledge of management. Rather, specific skills, aptitudes, talent, and accumulated personal experience are required.
> 
> - The concept of management as an art refers to the idea that *effective management involves* a combination of both *scientific principles* and *creative problem-solving* abilities. *Management is considered an __art__* because it involves using personal skills, intuition, and experience to achieve goals and solve problems, in addition to using established techniques and principles. The art of practical management involves a combination of *technical skills* and *creative problem-solving abilities*, and it requires a balance of science and art to be truly effective.
> 
> - Overall, the relationship between the practical and scientific aspects of management is often described as a **two-way** *street*, with each informing and shaping the other. The scientific study of management informs practical management techniques and practices, and practical experience provides valuable feedback for the development of management theory.

# What does the word ‘Manage‘ imply?

* __Managing__
  * Directional activity, when the managing entity (subject) makes decisions and transfers them to the managed entity (object) for execution.
* __Organizational Management__
  * The process of achieving the goals of an organization by using the necessary resources and applying the primary management functions – planning, organizing, influencing (leading, motivation) and controlling.

> [!note] 
> - The word "manage" comes from the Latin word "manu agere," which means "*to handle*" or "*to direct*." To manage means to execute directional activity, and it is a term that is closely related to the field of cybernetics. Cybernetics is a branch of science that studies *control and communication in complex systems*, providing a framework for understanding control and feedback mechanisms that are crucial in effective management.
> 
> - When we manage an organization, we *engage in a directional activity* to *coordinate people*, *resources*, and *systems* to create an efficient and effective work environment. This requires a combination of technical skills, interpersonal skills, and strategic decision-making to achieve the organization's goals and objectives. Effective management also requires the *ability to adapt to changing circumstances* and ensure that the organization operates in a sustainable and ethical manner.
> 
> - Organizational management involves a range of tasks and responsibilities, including *planning*, *organizing*, *leading*, and *controlling*. These activities are necessary to create an effective and efficient work environment that *aligns with the organization's goals* and stakeholders' needs. The goal of organizational management is to* balance competing demands and trade-offs* while ensuring that the organization operates in a sustainable and ethical manner.
> 
> - Effective organizational management requires a range of skills, including *leadership*, *communication*, *problem-solving*, and *decision-making*. Managers must be able to *adapt to changing circumstances* and align the goals of the organization with the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders, and society as a whole. By effectively managing an organization, managers can help to ensure that the organization remains *competitive*, achieves its goals, and makes a positive impact on the world.

## 6 fundamental elements of management process

- Subject – what/who manages?
- Object – what/who is managed?
- Purpose – what it seeks?
- Tools – wherewith?
- Methods – how it is done?
- Activities – management functions / processes

> [!note] 
> 
> - **Subject** - This refers to the *entity or person* that is responsible for managing or leading the organization or team. It could be an individual or a group of individuals.
> - **Object** - This refers to the *goals or objectives* that the manager or leader is trying to achieve through their actions. It could be a product, service, project, or any other deliverable that the organization is aiming to produce.
> - **Purpose** - This refers to the *reason or motivation* for the management or leadership actions being taken. It could be to increase profits, improve efficiency, or achieve a specific mission or vision.
> - **Tools** - This refers to the *resources, materials, and equipment* that the manager or leader uses to accomplish their objectives. It could be physical tools like computers, machinery, and equipment or non-physical tools like software, frameworks, or methodologies.
> - **Methods** - This refers to the *specific techniques or strategies* that the manager or leader uses to achieve their objectives. It could include planning, organizing, staffing, leading, or controlling.
> - **Activities** - These are the *specific functions or processes* that the manager or leader uses to achieve their objectives. They are often referred to as the "management functions" and include activities such as setting objectives, planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. These activities are often interrelated and interdependent and form the basis for effective management and leadership.


# Management Process: Primary Management Functions

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods1.jpg)

In the function approach proposed by the French industrialist Henri Fayol, all managers perform certain activities or functions

The four main management functions or activities that make up the management process are **planning**, **organizing**, **influencing**, and **controlling**

> [!note] 
> 
> - Management Process: Management is the process of *planning*, *organizing*, *influencing* (directing), and *controlling* an organization's resources *to achieve its goals and objectives*. This process involves the use of various tools and techniques to ensure that the organization is operating effectively and efficiently.
> - Primary Management Functions: The primary management functions include *planning*, *organizing*, *influencing* (directing), and *controlling*. These functions are interrelated and *must be performed in a coordinated manner* to achieve the goals of the organization.
> - **Henri Fayol**: Henri Fayol is a *French engineer* and management theorist who is best known for his contributions to the field of management. He proposed the five primary management functions and is considered one of the *pioneers of modern management theory*. Fayol believed that these functions were universal and could be applied to any type of organization, regardless of its size or industry.
> - It's important to note that Henri Fayol's work has been widely studied and has had a significant impact on the field of management. His ideas have been used to develop many of the management *concepts* and *practices that are widely used today*, making him an important figure in the history of management theory.



# Four Primary Management Functions

* __Planning__
  * Defining the organizational purpose and ways to achieve it
* __Organizing__
  * Arranging and structuring work to accomplish organizational goals
* __Influencing (leading, directing)__
  * Directing the work activities of others
* __Controlling__
  * Monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance

> Management process in practice

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods2.jpg)

Primary management functions are integrally related and therefore cannot be separated in practice.

__Decision-making__ is a part of all management functions.

> - To be effective, a manager must understand how the four management functions are practiced, not simply how they are defined and related. 
> 
> - The primary management functions of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling are integrally related in practice, meaning that *they are interdependent* and *cannot be separated*. Each of these functions plays a critical role in ensuring that an organization operates effectively and efficiently, and each function affects the others in a reciprocal manner.
> 
> - For example, consider the following scenario:
> 
> A company is planning to launch a new product and has set a goal to increase sales by 20% in the next quarter. To achieve this goal, the company's manager will engage in the following primary management functions:
> 
> Planning: The manager will plan the launch of the new product by determining the target market, setting a budget, and developing a marketing plan.
> Organizing: The manager will organize the resources needed to launch the new product, such as employees, equipment, and materials. This includes assigning tasks, determining the timeline, and establishing procedures.
> Directing: The manager will direct the employees by communicating the plan and expectations, providing guidance, and monitoring progress.
> Controlling: The manager will control the process by regularly assessing the progress towards the goal of increasing sales by 20%. If necessary, the manager will make adjustments to the plan to ensure that the goal is achieved.
> 
> In this scenario, each of the primary management functions is integrally related to the others and cannot be separated. The planning function sets the framework for the launch, the organizing function ensures that the necessary resources are in place, the directing function provides the guidance and motivation needed to carry out the plan, and the controlling function assesses progress and makes adjustments as needed. Without the integration of these functions, the goal of increasing sales by 20% is unlikely to be achieved.
> 
> Decision-making is closely related to all of the primary management functions in the sense that it is a critical component of each function. Decision-making is the process of choosing the best course of action from among several alternatives, and it is a key responsibility of managers in all organizations.
> 
> Planning: Effective planning requires decision-making at every stage, from setting goals and objectives to determining the best strategies for achieving those goals. Managers must make decisions about what to do, when to do it, and how to allocate resources to achieve their goals.
> Organizing: Organizing also requires decision-making, as managers must determine the most effective way to allocate resources and structure the organization to achieve its goals. This involves making decisions about the type of structure to adopt, the distribution of authority and responsibility, and the allocation of resources.
> Directing: The directing function also involves decision-making, as managers must make decisions about how to motivate and guide employees towards achieving the organization's goals. This includes decisions about how to provide feedback, rewards and incentives, and how to manage conflict.
> Controlling: The controlling function also requires decision-making, as managers must make decisions about how to monitor performance, assess progress towards goals, and make any necessary adjustments. This involves making decisions about how to measure performance, what metrics to use, and what actions to take to correct any deviations from the plan.
> In conclusion, decision-making is a critical component of all primary management functions and is essential for effective management. Good decision-making requires a thorough understanding of the organization's goals and objectives, a comprehensive assessment of the alternatives, and a careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of each alternative.

# What is an organization?

* __Organization__
  * A deliberate arrangement of people brought together to accomplish a specific purpose.
* __Common Characteristics of Organizations__
  * Distinct purpose
  * People (group) working together
  * A deliberate systematic structure

- Organisation can also refer to a system of arrangement or order, or a structure for classifying things.

- An organization is not just a business entity. Organizations and their goals can be very diverse!

# Welcome to a world made up of organizations!

# What is a theory?

- A theory is an explanation of a set of phenomena that has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through scientific experimentation and observation.

- It is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.

- Theories provide a framework for understanding how things work and make predictions about future events. They can also serve as a basis for further scientific investigation and discovery.

- Some examples of well-established scientific theories include the theory of evolution, the theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity.

# Development approaches and theories in management

The practice of management dates back thousands of years.

Individuals in positions of responsibility have been tasked with planning, organizing, leading, and controlling organized endeavors.

Management theories have evolved along with changes in society, including economic, political, social, cultural, technological, legal, and psychological factors.

The study of management and development of management theories are ongoing and continue to be shaped by the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of society.

# Classical Approaches

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods10.jpg)

_Scientific Management_

Frederick W. Taylor described scientific management as a method of scientifically finding the “one best way to do a job”

# Other Classic Approaches

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods11.jpg)

_General Administrative Theory_

focused on what constituted good management

Max Weber (pictured) described the bureaucracy as an ideal rational form of organization

Henri Fayol identified 5 management functions and 14 management principles

# Behavioural approaches: Key principles

__Employee involvement and empowerment__ : Encouraging employees to participate in decision-making and to take on more responsibility for their work can increase their motivation and job satisfaction.

__Communication and feedback:__ Encouraging open and honest communication between employees and managers can promote trust, understanding, and cooperation.

__Employee recognition and rewards:__ Recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

__Team building:__ Encouraging employees to work together as a team can increase cooperation, coordination, and productivity.

__Job design:__ Designing jobs to be challenging, meaningful, and satisfying can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

# Quantitative approaches

* Used quantitative techniques to improve decision making
* Evolved from mathematical and statistical solutions developed for military problems during World War II
* Key ideas applied in practice:
  * __Operations research:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the design and operation of systems and processes within organizations.
  * __Decision science:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to support decision-making and problem-solving within organizations.
  * __Performance measurement:__ Using quantitative metrics and data analysis to measure and improve organizational performance.
  * __Resource allocation:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the allocation of resources within organizations.

# Contemporary approaches

* _Management Science Approach:_
  * 1940s-1950s: Operations Research – This approach applied mathematical and statistical techniques to management problems. Notable figures include George Dantzig and Tjalling Koopmans.
  * 1950s-1960s: Linear Programming – This approach focused on optimizing resources and minimizing costs. Notable figures include George Dantzig and John von Neumann.
* _Systems Approach:_
  * 1960s: General Systems Theory – This approach emphasized the importance of understanding organizations as complex systems with interdependent components. Notable figures include Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Kenneth Boulding.
  * 1970s: Cybernetics – This approach applied the principles of control systems theory to management. Notable figures include Norbert Wiener and Stafford Beer.
* _Contingency Approach:_
  * 1960s-1970s: Contingency Theory – This approach proposed that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management and that the best approach depends on the specific circumstances. Notable figures include Joan Woodward and Paul Lawrence.

# What are management methods?

* _Management methods (techniques, practical toolkits)_
  * The ways in which managers influence collective and individual employees' behavior to achieve organizational goals
* _Groups of management methods_
  * Administrative
  * Economical
  * Social psychological

# Administrative methods

Administrative methods are based on the authority and discipline, when the manager directly tells subordinates what they must do by means of orders, decrees, instructions, directives and other acts

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods12.jpg)

# Economic methods

Economic management methods are based on the material promotion of employees with work results by linking the system of work payment, bonuses and bonuses, providing various goods and services to employees for free or at discounted prices, allocating investments and resources to organizational units, other economic incentives

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods13.jpg)

# Social-Psychological Methods

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods14.jpg)

Social psychological methods in management involve educating employees through personal example, persuasion, praise, promotion of initiative, involving employees in decision-making, creating a comfortable work environment, forming teams, fostering a favorable organizational culture, regulating relationships, promoting competition, organizing leisure activities, and preserving traditions.
