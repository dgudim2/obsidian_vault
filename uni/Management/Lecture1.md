# What is Management?

* __Practical Management__
  * Professional activity
  * As an art: the idea of a combination of both scientific principles and creative problem-solving abilities
* __Management as a Science__
  * Management as a science can be understood as a branch of study focused on the management of organizations.

> [!note] 
> 
> - **Management** is both a *practical* activity and a *branch of science*. As a practical activity, management involves *leading and directing people and resources* in an organization to achieve specific goals. This aspect of management involves the application of practical skills and techniques, such as *planning*, *organizing*, *motivating*, and *controlling*, to achieve organizational objectives. On the other hand, management is also a branch of science that involves the *systematic study and analysis* of the principles, theories, and practices of organizational leadership and management.
> 
> - **Management** can be defined as a field of study that focuses on *how to effectively manage organizations*. The knowledge base of management theory includes various concepts and theoretical frameworks that are related to other fields of science, such as *mathematics*, *statistics*, *economics*, *psychology*, *anthropology*, and more. However, there are also specific terms that are unique to the field of management.
> 
> - Different management theories and concepts are developed through *ongoing observations of real-world organizational* management practices. The practical experience of managers provides valuable insights and feedback for the development of management theory, while the scientific study of management helps to inform the practical application of management techniques and practices. The interplay between these two aspects of management is what makes it a dynamic and constantly evolving field.
> 
> - In the realm of practical management, managerial skills and qualifications are of paramount importance. It is not sufficient for a manager to possess solely the necessary knowledge of management. Rather, specific skills, aptitudes, talent, and accumulated personal experience are required.
> 
> - The concept of management as an art refers to the idea that *effective management involves* a combination of both *scientific principles* and *creative problem-solving* abilities. *Management is considered an __art__* because it involves using personal skills, intuition, and experience to achieve goals and solve problems, in addition to using established techniques and principles. The art of practical management involves a combination of *technical skills* and *creative problem-solving abilities*, and it requires a balance of science and art to be truly effective.
> 
> - Overall, the relationship between the practical and scientific aspects of management is often described as a **two-way** *street*, with each informing and shaping the other. The scientific study of management informs practical management techniques and practices, and practical experience provides valuable feedback for the development of management theory.

# What does the word ‘Manage‘ imply?

* __Managing__
  * Directional activity, when the managing entity (subject) makes decisions and transfers them to the managed entity (object) for execution.
* __Organizational Management__
  * The process of achieving the goals of an organization by using the necessary resources and applying the primary management functions – planning, organizing, influencing (leading, motivation) and controlling.

> [!note] 
> - The word "manage" comes from the Latin word "manu agere," which means "*to handle*" or "*to direct*." To manage means to execute directional activity, and it is a term that is closely related to the field of cybernetics. Cybernetics is a branch of science that studies *control and communication in complex systems*, providing a framework for understanding control and feedback mechanisms that are crucial in effective management.
> 
> - When we manage an organization, we *engage in a directional activity* to *coordinate people*, *resources*, and *systems* to create an efficient and effective work environment. This requires a combination of technical skills, interpersonal skills, and strategic decision-making to achieve the organization's goals and objectives. Effective management also requires the *ability to adapt to changing circumstances* and ensure that the organization operates in a sustainable and ethical manner.
> 
> - Organizational management involves a range of tasks and responsibilities, including *planning*, *organizing*, *leading*, and *controlling*. These activities are necessary to create an effective and efficient work environment that *aligns with the organization's goals* and stakeholders' needs. The goal of organizational management is to* balance competing demands and trade-offs* while ensuring that the organization operates in a sustainable and ethical manner.
> 
> - Effective organizational management requires a range of skills, including *leadership*, *communication*, *problem-solving*, and *decision-making*. Managers must be able to *adapt to changing circumstances* and align the goals of the organization with the needs and expectations of its stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders, and society as a whole. By effectively managing an organization, managers can help to ensure that the organization remains *competitive*, achieves its goals, and makes a positive impact on the world.

## 6 fundamental elements of management process

- Subject – what/who manages?
- Object – what/who is managed?
- Purpose – what it seeks?
- Tools – wherewith?
- Methods – how it is done?
- Activities – management functions / processes

> [!note] 
> 
> - **Subject** - This refers to the *entity or person* that is responsible for managing or leading the organization or team. It could be an individual or a group of individuals.
> - **Object** - This refers to the *goals or objectives* that the manager or leader is trying to achieve through their actions. It could be a product, service, project, or any other deliverable that the organization is aiming to produce.
> - **Purpose** - This refers to the *reason or motivation* for the management or leadership actions being taken. It could be to increase profits, improve efficiency, or achieve a specific mission or vision.
> - **Tools** - This refers to the *resources, materials, and equipment* that the manager or leader uses to accomplish their objectives. It could be physical tools like computers, machinery, and equipment or non-physical tools like software, frameworks, or methodologies.
> - **Methods** - This refers to the *specific techniques or strategies* that the manager or leader uses to achieve their objectives. It could include planning, organizing, staffing, leading, or controlling.
> - **Activities** - These are the *specific functions or processes* that the manager or leader uses to achieve their objectives. They are often referred to as the "management functions" and include activities such as setting objectives, planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. These activities are often interrelated and interdependent and form the basis for effective management and leadership.


# Management Process: Primary Management Functions

In the function approach proposed by the French industrialist **Henri Fayol**, all managers perform certain activities or functions

The four main management functions or activities that make up the management process are **planning**, **organizing**, **influencing**, and **controlling**

> [!note] 
> 
> - Management Process: Management is the process of *planning*, *organizing*, *influencing* (directing), and *controlling* an organization's resources *to achieve its goals and objectives*. This process involves the use of various tools and techniques to ensure that the organization is operating effectively and efficiently.
> - Primary Management Functions: The primary management functions include *planning*, *organizing*, *influencing* (directing), and *controlling*. These functions are interrelated and *must be performed in a coordinated manner* to achieve the goals of the organization.
> - **Henri Fayol**: Henri Fayol is a *French engineer* and management theorist who is best known for his contributions to the field of management. He proposed the five primary management functions and is considered one of the *pioneers of modern management theory*. Fayol believed that these functions were universal and could be applied to any type of organization, regardless of its size or industry.
> - It's important to note that Henri Fayol's work has been widely studied and has had a significant impact on the field of management. His ideas have been used to develop many of the management *concepts* and *practices that are widely used today*, making him an important figure in the history of management theory.



# Four Primary Management Functions

* __Planning__
  * Defining the organizational purpose and ways to achieve it
* __Organizing__
  * Arranging and structuring work to accomplish organizational goals
* __Influencing (leading, directing)__
  * Directing the work activities of others
* __Controlling__
  * Monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance

> Management process in practice

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods2.jpg)

Primary management functions are integrally related and therefore cannot be separated in practice.

__Decision-making__ is a part of all management functions.

> [!note]
> - To be *effective*, a manager must understand how the *four management functions* are practiced, not simply how they are defined and related. 
> 
> - The primary management functions of *planning*, *organizing*, *directing*, and *controlling* are integrally related in practice, meaning that *they are interdependent* and *cannot be separated*. Each of these functions plays a critical role in ensuring that an organization operates effectively and efficiently, and each function affects the others in a reciprocal manner.
> 
> - For example, consider the following scenario:
> 
> - A company is *planning* to launch a *new product* and has set a goal to increase sales by 20% in the next quarter. To achieve this goal, the company's manager will engage in the <u>following primary management functions</u>:
> 
> 	- **Planning**: The manager will plan the launch of the new product by determining the target market, setting a budget, and developing a marketing plan.
>   
> 	- **Organizing**: The manager will organize the resources needed to launch the new product, such as employees, equipment, and materials. This includes assigning tasks, determining the timeline, and establishing procedures.
>   
> 	- **Directing**: The manager will direct the employees by communicating the plan and expectations, providing guidance, and monitoring progress.
>   
> 	- **Controlling**: The manager will control the process by regularly assessing the progress towards the goal of increasing sales by 20%. If necessary, the manager will make adjustments to the plan to ensure that the goal is achieved.
> 
> - In this scenario, each of the primary management functions is *integrally related* to the others and cannot be separated. The planning function sets the framework for the launch, the organizing function ensures that the necessary resources are in place, the directing function provides the guidance and motivation needed to carry out the plan, and the controlling function assesses progress and makes adjustments as needed. Without the integration of these functions, the goal of increasing sales by 20% is unlikely to be achieved.
> 
> - <u>Decision-making</u> is *closely related* to all of the primary management functions in the sense that it is a critical component of each function. Decision-making is the process of choosing the best course of action from among several alternatives, and it is a key responsibility of managers in all organizations.
> 
> 	- **Planning**: Effective planning requires decision-making at every stage, from setting goals and objectives to determining the best strategies for achieving those goals. Managers must *make decisions* about what to do, when to do it, and how to allocate resources to achieve their goals.
>   
> 	- **Organizing**: Organizing also requires decision-making, as managers must determine the most effective way to allocate resources and structure the organization to achieve its goals. This involves making decisions about the type of structure to adopt, the distribution of authority and responsibility, and the allocation of resources.
>   
> 	- **Directing**: The directing function also involves decision-making, as managers must make decisions about how to motivate and guide employees towards achieving the organization's goals. This includes decisions about how to provide feedback, rewards and incentives, and how to manage conflict.
>   
> 	- **Controlling**: The controlling function also requires decision-making, as managers must make decisions about how to monitor performance, assess progress towards goals, and make any necessary adjustments. This involves making decisions about how to measure performance, what metrics to use, and what actions to take to correct any deviations from the plan.
> 
>> [!tldr] 
>> In conclusion, decision-making is a **critical** component of all primary management functions and is essential for effective management. 
>> Good *decision-making* requires a *thorough understanding* of the organization's goals and objectives, a comprehensive assessment of the alternatives, and a careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of each alternative.

# What is an organization?

* __Organization__
  * A deliberate arrangement of people brought together to accomplish a specific purpose.
* __Common Characteristics of Organizations__
  * Distinct purpose
  * People (group) working together
  * A deliberate systematic structure

> [!note] 
> 
> - In management theory, an organization is a *social unit of people* that is *structured* and *managed* to meet a common goal or set of goals. An organization can be *for-profit*, *non-profit*, or *government-run*, and can be of any size, from a small business to a large multinational corporation.
> 
> - An organization is a *complex system* that involves various elements, including **people**, **technology**, **processes**, and **structure**. Effective management of an organization requires an understanding of how these elements interact and how to manage them effectively to achieve the organization's goals.
> 
> - In management theory, the structure of an organization is often described as a *hierarchy*, with different levels of *authority* and *responsibility*. This structure is used to ensure that the organization is efficient, with clear lines of *communication and accountability*.
> 
> - The goal of management in an organization is to *effectively utilize the resources at its disposal* to *achieve its goals and objectives*. This requires the use of various management functions, including planning, organizing, directing, and controlling, to ensure that the organization is operating effectively and efficiently.
> 
>> [!tldr] 
>> In conclusion, an organization as understood in management theory is *a social unit of people* structured and managed to meet a common goal or set of goals. Effective management of an organization requires an *understanding* of its structure and the *interplay* between its various elements, as well as the use of *various management functions* to achieve its goals and objectives.

- Organisation can also refer to a *system of arrangement or order*, or a structure for classifying things.

- An organization is *not just a business entity*. Organizations and their goals can be very diverse!

# Welcome to a world made up of organizations!

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods7.jpg)

> [!note] 
> 
> - It is accurate to say that we are living in a *world made up of organizations*. Organizations play a *critical role* in modern society and are an integral part of our daily lives. They are responsible for providing **goods** and **services**, **creating jobs**, and contributing to economic growth and development.
> 
> - Organizations can be found in almost every aspect of our lives, from the *businesses* we work for, to the *schools* we attend, to the *government agencies* that provide essential services. They are also involved in important societal issues, such as *healthcare*, the *environment*, and *social justice*.
> 
> - In today's globalized world, organizations are also becoming *increasingly interdependent*, forming complex networks of relationships and partnerships. This has led to an *increased focus* on the role of organizations in shaping the world and addressing major global challenges.
>
>> [!tldr]
>> In conclusion, organizations are a *fundamental part of modern society* and play a *critical role* in our daily lives. They are responsible for providing **goods** and **services**, creating **jobs**, and contributing to economic growth and development, as well as addressing important societal issues.

# What is a theory?

- A theory is an explanation of a set of phenomena that has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through scientific experimentation and observation.

- It is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.

- Theories provide a framework for understanding how things work and make predictions about future events. They can also serve as a basis for further scientific investigation and discovery.

- Some examples of well-established scientific theories include the theory of evolution, the theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity.

# Development approaches and theories in management

- The practice of management dates back thousands of years.

- Individuals in positions of responsibility have been tasked with **planning**, **organizing**, **leading**, and **controlling** organized endeavors.

- Management theories have evolved along with changes in society, including *economic*, *political*, *social*, *cultural*, *technological*, *legal*, and *psychological* factors.

- The study of management and development of management theories are ongoing and continue to be shaped by the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of society.

# A Brief History of Management’s Roots

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods9.jpg)

> [!note] 
> 
> The history of management theory can be *traced back to ancient civilizations*, where individuals in positions of responsibility were tasked with the planning, organizing, leading, and controlling of organized endeavors. 
> However, it wasn't until the *late 19th* and *early 20th* centuries that management theory as a discipline began to take shape.
> 
> Some of the most important management theories and their relationships with important historical events and periods include:
> 
> - [[#Scientific Management]] (1900s): Developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor, this theory aimed to increase efficiency by breaking down tasks into smaller, simpler components. This theory was popular during the Industrial Revolution, as businesses sought to increase productivity.
> - [[#Administrative Management]] (1920s): Developed by Henri Fayol, this theory emphasized the importance of effective management practices and introduced the five primary management functions (planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling). This theory was influenced by the growing popularity of bureaucracy in government and business during this period.
> - **Human Relations Movement** (1930s-1940s): This theory, led by Elton Mayo, focused on the importance of understanding the social and psychological aspects of work. It emphasized the importance of employee satisfaction and motivation in improving productivity.
> - **Contingency Theory** (1960s-1970s): This theory recognized that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management and that the best course of action depends on the specific situation. It influenced the development of situational leadership, which emphasizes the importance of adapting one's leadership style to the needs of individual employees.
> 
> When discussing modern approaches in management theory, it is important to highlight the following:
> 
> - **Evidence-Based Management**: This approach emphasizes the importance of data and research in making informed decisions. It encourages managers to use data and research to make evidence-based decisions, rather than relying on intuition or experience alone.
> - **Agile Management**: This approach is designed for organizations operating in rapidly changing environments, such as technology companies. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement, and is often used in software development.
> - **Servant Leadership**: This approach focuses on the leader as a servant to their employees, rather than a traditional hierarchical leader. It emphasizes the importance of empowering employees and creating a positive work environment.
> - **Holistic Management**: This approach recognizes that organizations are made up of multiple interconnected systems, and that success depends on managing these systems in a holistic manner. It emphasizes sustainability, balance, and a long-term perspective.
> - **System Thinking**: This approach recognizes that organizations are complex systems and that decisions and actions in one part of the organization can have a ripple effect throughout the entire system. It emphasizes the importance of considering the larger system when making decisions.
> 
> These are just a few examples of modern approaches in management theory. Each approach offers unique insights and perspectives on the role of management in organizations and the ways in which managers can create effective and efficient organizations.
> 
>> [!tldr] 
>> 
>> In conclusion, the history of management theory is *rich and diverse*, *reflecting the changing landscape* of society and the evolving needs of businesses and organizations. These theories *continue to shape* the field of management and inform modern practices and approaches to management.

# Classical Approaches

## Scientific Management

- Frederick W. Taylor described scientific management as a method of scientifically finding the “**one best way to do a job**”

> [!note] 
> 
> Scientific management is a management theory that was first introduced by Frederick **Winslow Taylor** in the *late 19th* century. The main focus of scientific management was to increase efficiency by *breaking down* tasks into *smaller, simpler components* and *optimizing* each component for *maximum productivity*.
> 
> The key elements of scientific management include:
> 
> - **Time and Motion Studies**: Taylor believed that the best way to increase efficiency was to study each task in detail and determine the most efficient way to perform it. This involved analyzing the time and motion involved in each task to identify areas for improvement.
> - **Division of Labor**: Taylor believed that dividing tasks into smaller, specialized components would allow each worker to become more efficient and productive. He argued that this would allow workers to focus on a specific aspect of the task and become experts in that area.
> - **Standardization of Work**: Taylor believed that standardizing the way tasks were performed would increase efficiency and reduce variability. This involved establishing clear procedures for each task and training workers to perform the task in the most efficient manner.
> - **Scientific Selection and Training** of Workers: Taylor believed that workers should be selected and trained based on their ability to perform specific tasks. He argued that this would ensure that the right person was in the right job and that they would be able to perform the task to the best of their ability.
> 
> While **scientific management** had a profound impact on the field of management and was widely adopted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it has since been criticized for its narrow focus on efficiency and its disregard for the social and psychological aspects of work. 
> Nevertheless, many of the concepts and techniques introduced by Taylor *continue to be used* and applied in modern management practices.
>

## Administrative Management

- Focused on what constituted good management
- **Max Weber** described the bureaucracy as an ideal rational form of organization
- Henri Fayol identified **5** management *functions* and **14** management *principles*

> [!note] 
> 
> **General Administrative Theory** is a management theory that was developed by **Henri Fayol** in the *early 20th* century. 
> It is considered *one of the earliest management theories* and is widely recognized as the foundation of modern management thought.
> 
> *Max Weber* was a German sociologist and political economist who is best known for his work on the theory of bureaucracy. 
> He developed the *concept of bureaucracy* as a *means of describing the structure and functioning of organizations* in a **systematic** and *rational* manner.
> 
> According to Weber, a bureaucracy is a *hierarchical organization* that is characterized by a *clear division of labor*, a *formal system of rules and regulations*, and a system of *impersonal relationships between employees*. He believed that a bureaucracy was the <u>most efficient and effective type of organization</u>, and that it offered several key advantages over other forms of organization, including:
> - **Predictability** and Consistency: Weber believed that a bureaucracy would operate in a predictable and consistent manner, with each employee following a set of clear rules and procedures.
> - **Expertise**: Weber believed that a bureaucracy would attract and retain experts in their respective fields, allowing organizations to make use of the most knowledgeable and experienced employees.
> - **Impartiality**: Weber believed that the impersonal relationships within a bureaucracy would promote impartial decision-making and reduce the influence of personal biases and prejudices.
> - **Efficiency**: Weber believed that the clear division of labor and standardized procedures within a bureaucracy would increase efficiency and reduce waste.
> 
> However, Weber also recognized the potential *drawbacks* of bureaucracy, including the potential for **excessive bureaucracy** and the **stifling of creativity and innovation**. 
> Despite these limitations, bureaucracy remains an *important concept* in the field of management and is widely studied and applied in modern organizations.
> 
> *Fayol* identified **five primary functions** of management: **planning**, **organizing**, **commanding**, **coordinating**, and **controlling**. He believed that these functions were universal and applied to all organizations, regardless of size or type.
> 
> *Fayol* also introduced the concept of "**14 principles of management**", which outline the key principles that managers should follow in order to be effective. 
> These principles include:
> - division of work
> - authority
> - discipline
> - unity of direction
> - unity of command
> - subordination of individual interests to the general interest
> - remuneration
> - centralization
> - scalar chain
> - order
> - equity
> - stability of tenure
> - initiative
> - esprit de corps.
> 
> In addition to the primary functions and principles of management, **Fayol** also emphasized the *importance of effective communication*, both **within** the organization and **between** the organization and its stakeholders. 
> He believed that clear and effective communication was essential for promoting cooperation and coordination among employees and for achieving organizational goals.
> 
> Overall, General Administrative Theory *has had a lasting impact* on the field of management, and many of Fayol's ideas and concepts *continue to be widely taught* and applied in modern management practices.

# Behavioural approaches: Key principles

> [!definition] 
> 
> - **Behavioral approaches** in management are a *group of management theories* that focus on *understanding and improving* the behavior of individuals and groups within organizations. This approach to management emerged in the **mid-20th** century, as a response to the more traditional, formalist approach to management that focused on structural and technical aspects of organizations.
> 
> - **Behavioral approaches** in management recognize that people are *not simply resources to be managed*, but that they have their own *needs*, *motivations*, and *perceptions* that can influence their behavior at work. As a result, behavioral approaches in management aim to create a work environment that is supportive, motivating, and responsive to the needs of employees.

__Employee involvement and empowerment__ : Encouraging employees to participate in decision-making and to take on more responsibility for their work can increase their motivation and job satisfaction.

__Communication and feedback:__ Encouraging open and honest communication between employees and managers can promote trust, understanding, and cooperation.

__Employee recognition and rewards:__ Recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

__Team building:__ Encouraging employees to work together as a team can increase cooperation, coordination, and productivity.

__Job design:__ Designing jobs to be challenging, meaningful, and satisfying can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

# Quantitative approaches

* Used quantitative techniques to improve decision making
* Evolved from mathematical and statistical solutions developed for military problems during World War II
* Key ideas applied in practice:
  * __Operations research:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the design and operation of systems and processes within organizations.
  * __Decision science:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to support decision-making and problem-solving within organizations.
  * __Performance measurement:__ Using quantitative metrics and data analysis to measure and improve organizational performance.
  * __Resource allocation:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the allocation of resources within organizations.

# Contemporary approaches

* _Management Science Approach:_
  * 1940s-1950s: Operations Research – This approach applied mathematical and statistical techniques to management problems. Notable figures include George Dantzig and Tjalling Koopmans.
  * 1950s-1960s: Linear Programming – This approach focused on optimizing resources and minimizing costs. Notable figures include George Dantzig and John von Neumann.
* _Systems Approach:_
  * 1960s: General Systems Theory – This approach emphasized the importance of understanding organizations as complex systems with interdependent components. Notable figures include Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Kenneth Boulding.
  * 1970s: Cybernetics – This approach applied the principles of control systems theory to management. Notable figures include Norbert Wiener and Stafford Beer.
* _Contingency Approach:_
  * 1960s-1970s: Contingency Theory – This approach proposed that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management and that the best approach depends on the specific circumstances. Notable figures include Joan Woodward and Paul Lawrence.

# What are management methods?

* _Management methods (techniques, practical toolkits)_
  * The ways in which managers influence collective and individual employees' behavior to achieve organizational goals
* _Groups of management methods_
  * Administrative
  * Economical
  * Social psychological

> [!note] 
> 
> Management methods are *techniques and approaches* used by **managers** and **leaders** to effectively **plan**, **organize**, **lead**, and **control** the activities of an organization. These methods are typically based on management theories and principles, and are designed to support decision-making and problem-solving, to improve organizational performance, and to achieve organizational goals.
> 
> The grouping of management methods into **economical**, **social-psychological**, and **administrative** methods is a way of categorizing different approaches to management, based on the dominant focus or emphasis of each method.
> 
> - [[#Economic methods]]: These methods are primarily focused on the **efficient use of resources** and maximizing economic returns. Examples of economical methods include cost-benefit analysis, return on investment (ROI) analysis, and break-even analysis.
> 
> - [[#Social-Psychological Methods]]: These methods are focused on **improving the motivation** and engagement of employees, and on creating a positive work environment. Examples of social-psychological methods include employee empowerment, participative management, and job enrichment.
> 
> - [[#Administrative methods]]: These methods are focused on the **design and structure** of organizations, and on the systems and processes used to manage and control organizational activities. Examples of administrative methods include organizational design, operational planning and control, and performance management.
> 
> This categorization of management methods provides a useful framework for understanding the different approaches that are available to managers and leaders, and for selecting the most appropriate methods for a given context. It should be noted, however, that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and many management methods may have elements of each category.
> 

## Administrative methods

> [!definition] 
> 
> Administrative methods are based on the *authority and discipline*, when the manager directly tells subordinates *what they must do* by means of **orders**, **decrees**, **instructions**, **directives** and other acts

## Economic methods

> [!definition] 
> 
> Economic management methods are based on the **material promotion** of employees with work results by linking the system of work payment, bonuses and bonuses, providing various goods and services to employees for free or at discounted prices, allocating investments and resources to organizational units, other economic incentives

## Social-Psychological Methods

> [!definition] 
> 
> Social psychological methods in management involve *educating employees* through *personal example*, *persuasion*, *praise*, promotion of initiative, involving employees in decision-making, creating a comfortable work environment, forming teams, fostering a favorable organizational culture, regulating relationships, promoting competition, organizing leisure activities, and preserving traditions.
