# What is Management?

* __Practical Management__
  * Professional activity
  * As an art: the idea of a combination of both scientific principles and creative problem-solving abilities
* __Management as a Science__
  * Management as a science can be understood as a branch of study focused on the management of organizations.

# What does the word ‘Manage‘ implies?

* __Managing__
  * Directional activity, when the managing entity (subject) makes decisions and transfers them to the managed entity (object) for execution.
* __Organizational Management__
  * the process of achieving the goals of an organization by using the necessary resources and applying the primary management functions – planning, organizing, influencing (leading, motivation) and controlling.

## 6 fundamental elements of management process

- Subject – what/who manages?
- Object – what/who is managed?
- Purpose – what it seeks?
- Tools – wherewith?
- Methods – how it is done?
- Activities – management functions / processes

# Management Process: Primary Management Functions

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods1.jpg)

In the function approach proposed by the French industrialist Henri Fayol, all managers perform certain activities or functions

The four main management functions or activities that make up the management process are planning, organizing, influencing, and controlling

# Four Primary Management Functions

* _Planning_
  * Defining the organizational purpose and ways to achieve it
* _Organizing_
  * Arranging and structuring work to accomplish organizational goals
* _Influencing (leading, directing)_
  * Directing the work activities of others
* _Controlling_
  * Monitoring, comparing, and correcting work performance

Primary management functions are integrally related and therefore cannot be separated in practice.

__Decision-making__ is a part of all management functions.

# What is an organization?

* __Organization__
  * A deliberate arrangement of people brought together to accomplish a specific purpose.
* __Common Characteristics of Organizations__
  * Distinct purpose
  * People (group) working together
  * A deliberate systematic structure

- Organisation can also refer to a system of arrangement or order, or a structure for classifying things.

- An organization is not just a business entity. Organizations and their goals can be very diverse!

# Welcome to a world made up of organizations!

# What is a theory?

- A theory is an explanation of a set of phenomena that has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through scientific experimentation and observation.

- It is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.

- Theories provide a framework for understanding how things work and make predictions about future events. They can also serve as a basis for further scientific investigation and discovery.

- Some examples of well-established scientific theories include the theory of evolution, the theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity.

# Development approaches and theories in management

The practice of management dates back thousands of years.

Individuals in positions of responsibility have been tasked with planning, organizing, leading, and controlling organized endeavors.

Management theories have evolved along with changes in society, including economic, political, social, cultural, technological, legal, and psychological factors.

The study of management and development of management theories are ongoing and continue to be shaped by the dynamic and ever-changing landscape of society.

# Classical Approaches

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods10.jpg)

_Scientific Management_

Frederick W. Taylor described scientific management as a method of scientifically finding the “one best way to do a job”

# Other Classic Approaches

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods11.jpg)

_General Administrative Theory_

focused on what constituted good management

Max Weber (pictured) described the bureaucracy as an ideal rational form of organization

Henri Fayol identified 5 management functions and 14 management principles

# Behavioural approaches: Key principles

__Employee involvement and empowerment__ : Encouraging employees to participate in decision-making and to take on more responsibility for their work can increase their motivation and job satisfaction.

__Communication and feedback:__ Encouraging open and honest communication between employees and managers can promote trust, understanding, and cooperation.

__Employee recognition and rewards:__ Recognizing and rewarding employees for their contributions can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

__Team building:__ Encouraging employees to work together as a team can increase cooperation, coordination, and productivity.

__Job design:__ Designing jobs to be challenging, meaningful, and satisfying can increase motivation and job satisfaction.

# Quantitative approaches

* Used quantitative techniques to improve decision making
* Evolved from mathematical and statistical solutions developed for military problems during World War II
* Key ideas applied in practice:
  * __Operations research:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the design and operation of systems and processes within organizations.
  * __Decision science:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to support decision-making and problem-solving within organizations.
  * __Performance measurement:__ Using quantitative metrics and data analysis to measure and improve organizational performance.
  * __Resource allocation:__ Using mathematical models and statistical analysis to optimize the allocation of resources within organizations.

# Contemporary approaches

* _Management Science Approach:_
  * 1940s-1950s: Operations Research – This approach applied mathematical and statistical techniques to management problems. Notable figures include George Dantzig and Tjalling Koopmans.
  * 1950s-1960s: Linear Programming – This approach focused on optimizing resources and minimizing costs. Notable figures include George Dantzig and John von Neumann.
* _Systems Approach:_
  * 1960s: General Systems Theory – This approach emphasized the importance of understanding organizations as complex systems with interdependent components. Notable figures include Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Kenneth Boulding.
  * 1970s: Cybernetics – This approach applied the principles of control systems theory to management. Notable figures include Norbert Wiener and Stafford Beer.
* _Contingency Approach:_
  * 1960s-1970s: Contingency Theory – This approach proposed that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management and that the best approach depends on the specific circumstances. Notable figures include Joan Woodward and Paul Lawrence.

# What are management methods?

* _Management methods (techniques, practical toolkits)_
  * The ways in which managers influence collective and individual employees' behavior to achieve organizational goals
* _Groups of management methods_
  * Administrative
  * Economical
  * Social psychological

# Administrative methods

Administrative methods are based on the authority and discipline, when the manager directly tells subordinates what they must do by means of orders, decrees, instructions, directives and other acts

# Economic methods

Economic management methods are based on the material promotion of employees with work results by linking the system of work payment, bonuses and bonuses, providing various goods and services to employees for free or at discounted prices, allocating investments and resources to organizational units, other economic incentives

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods13.jpg)

# Social-Psychological Methods

![](img/Lecture%201%20-%20The%20Essence%20of%20Management%20Management%20Methods14.jpg)

Social psychological methods in management involve educating employees through personal example, persuasion, praise, promotion of initiative, involving employees in decision-making, creating a comfortable work environment, forming teams, fostering a favorable organizational culture, regulating relationships, promoting competition, organizing leisure activities, and preserving traditions.
