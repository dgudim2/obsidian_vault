# What is organizational climate?

![](img/Lecture%2010%20-%20Organizational%20Culture1.png)

* Organizational climate
  * Refers to how an employee experiences and perceives the work environment and culture in which they work\.
  * Organizational culture is a broader concept\, while climate is more narrowly defined in terms of employees' overall perceptions of an organization's policies\, practices\, procedures\, and compensation systems\.

# Strong and weak organizational culture

* Culture is strong when organizational members act because their values are aligned with the organization's values\.
  * People act because they believe what they do is what should be done\.
  * The danger of groupthink \(excessive trust in a central charismatic leader\, over\-reliance on organizational values\): people cannot resist groupthink\, and innovative ideas are diminished\.
* Culture is weak when these values tend to deviate from the organization's values\.
  * Control is used\, which manifests in numerous bureaucratic procedures\.
* Organizations that seek innovation require people who are willing to think critically and creatively about the current situation – regardless of whether the organization is dominated by groupthink or bureaucracy\.

  * Person culture

# Classification of organizational culture based on psychological criteria (1)

* Paranoid culture
  * Organizations that exhibit a paranoid culture are characterized by attributes of distrust and fear\. In such organizations\, leaders react vehemently to any interference\. They constantly look for other people's mistakes and those who want to harm them\.
* Coercion\-based culture
  * Organizations with a coercion\-based culture emphasize order\, and relationships among people are characterized by a focus on obedience\. In such organizations\, unexpected events must be eliminated\, everything is considered and regulated\, and emotions are unnecessary\.
* Depressive culture
  * It is characterized by fear and mistrust\, as well as pessimistic forecasts\. It is clear that in such organizations\, fate is believed in\, and support is expected from elsewhere\. It is natural that in such circumstances\, the life of the organization revolves around a routine environment\, where routine determines people's behavior\.

* Schizoid culture
  * In this culture\, the behavior of top\-level managers is influenced by distance and distrust\, with a noticeable indifference \- neither making friends nor getting angry\. There is a power vacuum at lower levels of management\, so there is a struggle for position\, coalitions are formed\, and informal groups emerge\.
* Opportunistic culture
  * In such a culture\, there is usually a certain closedness and a tendency to offend\. People's behavior in such companies is usually influenced by the integration of values ​​based on exclusivity and the denial of individual culture\. In such a company\, procedure is more important than the essence of the matter\.
* Commitment culture
  * It is an open culture in terms of both business and social aspects\, willing to implant other differentiated cultures\, and exchange ideas\. However\, in such a culture\, there is a risk of a value conflict\, and a lot of time is spent on coordinating interests\. Therefore\, such a culture can be a reason for high costs\.

Organizational culture refers to shared values\, beliefs\, and practices that shape people's behavior in an organization\, while organizational climate refers to the prevailing atmosphere or tone that characterizes the work environment of an organization\.Organizational culture is relatively stable and long\-lasting\, while organizational climate is more dynamic and can change over time\.

The elements of organizational culture include three layers consisting of artifacts and symbols\, supported by values and underlying assumptions\. While the artifacts and symbols layer is quite visible\, and the underlying assumptions layer is completely invisible\, the elements of all three layers are interrelated and influence each other\.

Creativity is a vital aspect of organizational culture that can drive innovation\, growth\, and competitive advantage for organizations\.
