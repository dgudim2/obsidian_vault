# Application of system theory to management theory

- In the mid-20th century, researchers in various fields began exploring systems as a way of understanding complex phenomena.

- The general systems theory was developed in the 1960s and adopted to integrate systems thinking into management theory.

- The systems theory viewed organizations as open systems that interact with their environment.

- Systems thinking emphasizes the importance of understanding the entire system, including interactions between parts of the organization.

- Today, the systemic approach is widely used in management and is an important perspective for understanding and improving organizational performance.

# System approach: Understanding complex phenomena

- Systems approach is a way of analyzing and understanding complex phenomena

- It involves looking at a system as a whole and its parts, as well as the relationships and interactions between them or, in other words it involves looking at the big picture and understanding the underlying patterns and structures that drive behaviour and outcomes.

- Recognizes that changing one part of a system can have impacts on other parts of the system and on the system as a whole

- Useful in situations where complex issues and uncertainty exist and where multiple perspectives and disciplines are involved

- Helps to develop more effective and sustainable solutions that consider the entire system, rather than just isolated parts of it

# Important terms related to systems theory

﻿A __system__ is a number of interdependent parts (elements) functioning as a whole for some purpose.

  * __Elements__
  * __Interconnections, relations__
  * __Structure__
  * __Boundaries__
  * __Environment__
  * __Sub-system__
  * __Input__
  * __Output__
  * __Transformative process__
  * __Purpose, function__

# Open system model

  * With the help of a systemic approach, any object or process can be analyzed as __a whole__

# Organization as an open system

__External environment__

__Internal environment__

# Management process as a system

From the perspective of the cybernetic control model, management is the process of changing the state of the management object in order to achieve a specific goal.

Recall from previous lecture – 6 fundamental elements of management

# Organization as a management object

According to the systemic approach, organizations are rational systems that can be managed.

If organizations can be managed, they are considered as objects of management.

As a management object, organizations can be understood as a set of various sub-systems: resources, existing relationships, ongoing processes, and tools used to achieve goals and objectives.

When applying a systemic approach to organizational management, a significant emphasis is placed on the analysis of the organization's internal and external environments.

If an organization is viewed as a management object, it means that it is seen as a rational system that can be analyzed and managed using standardized tools and methods.

# Classifation of organizations

* Classification of organizations is based on various features, including size, formality, organizational structure, ownership, legal form, functional purpose, etc.
  * __Size__  categories include small, medium, large, and extra large.
  * __Formality__  categories include formal and informal organizations.
  * __Organizational structure __ categories include flat, matrix, linear, and other structures.
  * __Ownership categories__  include private, public, state-owned, and other forms of ownership.
  * __Legal form __ categories include individual company, small partnership, closed joint stock company, and other legal forms.
  * __Functional purpose __ categories include manufacturing companies, wholesale/retail trade companies, financial organizations, infrastructure organizations, clubs, political parties, communities of believers, schools, and other types of organizations.
  * Etc.
* There is no single, unified classification of modern organizations that can fully capture their diversity and complexity.

# Technology in organizations

* _Technology_
  * In the context of organizational management, technology is a specific way of operating an organization, in which the object of work is transformed into a product using tools.
  * It includes both physical and organizational technologies.
  * Both the variety of organizations and the technologies they use are very diverse.

# Classification of technology

Technologies are diverse and constantly evolving, reflecting the wide range of human activities and the need for innovative solutions to various challenges.

Technologies are often classified according to their purpose (information and communication technologies, production technologies, energy technologies, environmental technologies, transportation technologies, construction technologies, bioengineering technologies, etc.).

Other proposals for classification include categorizing technologies:

Information technology (IT) vs. operational technology (OT)

Emerging vs. established technology

Hard vs. soft technology

General-purpose vs. specialized technology

Process vs. product technology

Green Technology vs Conventional Technology

Core Technology vs Support Technology

Disruptive Technology vs Sustaining Technology

# The importance of technology in organizational management

__Improved Efficiency: __ Technology can automate and streamline many business processes, making them more efficient and reducing the need for manual labor.

__Improved Decision-Making: __ Technology provides access to vast amounts of data and information, which can help managers make more informed decisions.

__Improved Communication: __ Technology has revolutionized communication, enabling managers to communicate with employees, customers, and partners more effectively and efficiently.

__Improved Innovation: __ Technology can enable companies to develop new products and services, create new business models, and enter new markets.

__Improved Customer Experience: __ Technology can enable companies to deliver better customer experiences, with features like online ordering, personalized recommendations, and 24/7 customer support.

# What is the organizational environment?

What is the external environment of an organization?

* _External environment_
  * The external environment includes factors that are beyond the control of the organization and have an impact on its activities and results. The organization cannot do much to avoid the influence of these factors. It simply has to adapt to them.
* _External environmental factors:_
  * PESTLE: political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental factors.

What is the internal environment of an organization?

* _Internal environment_
  * The internal environment consists of elements that have an impact on the organization's activities and decision-making. The organization can control these elements. In other words, these elements have an effect, but the organization can change their quality so that their impact is desirable.
* _Internal environmental factors_
  * Material, financial, human, informational, technological resources, organizational culture, organizational structure, goal system, processes, policies, and so on.

# What are analysis methods for internal environment analysis?

- SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

- Resource analysis, including identifying and assessing the availability, quality, and utility of an organization's resources and capabilities

- Value chain analysis, which involves examining an organization's activities and processes to identify areas where it can add value and improve efficiency

- Financial analysis, including examining an organization's financial statements and performance to identify strengths and weaknesses

- Organizational culture analysis, including understanding an organization's values, beliefs, and assumptions, and how they affect its operations and performance

- Employee surveys and feedback, which can help to identify issues and opportunities within the organization's internal environment

- Management information systems (MIS) and information technology (IT) analysis, including assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's IT systems and processes, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

It's worth noting that some of these methods can also be used for external environment analysis, and that different organizations may choose to focus on different methods depending on their specific needs and goals.

The organisation cannot resolve the problems that exist in the external environment. It can create a strategy to use these problems as an opportunity or neutralise them as a threat.

For finding a solution for these type of problems, the SWOT analysis tool is usually used.
