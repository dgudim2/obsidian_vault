# Application of system theory to management theory

- In the mid-20th century, researchers in various fields began exploring systems as a way of understanding complex phenomena.

- The general systems theory was developed in the 1960s and adopted to integrate systems thinking into management theory.

- The systems theory viewed organizations as open systems that interact with their environment.

- Systems thinking emphasizes the importance of understanding the entire system, including interactions between parts of the organization.

- Today, the systemic approach is widely used in management and is an important perspective for understanding and improving organizational performance.

> [!note] 
> - The application of system theory to management theory began in the *mid-20th century*. In the 1940s and 1950s, researchers in various fields, including engineering, biology, and psychology, were exploring the idea of systems as a way of understanding complex phenomena.
> 
> - In the 1960s, a group of management theorists, led by Kenneth Boulding, adopted the concept of the "general systems theory" as a way of integrating systems thinking into management theory. This theory viewed organizations as open systems that interact with their environment, taking in inputs and producing outputs.
> 
> - During this time, several management theorists, including Peter Drucker and Chester Barnard, began to apply system theory to the study of organizations. They recognized that organizations were complex, interdependent systems that could be analyzed and understood using systems thinking.
> 
> - Other management theorists, such as W. Edwards Deming and Peter Senge, further developed and popularized the idea of systems thinking in management. They emphasized the importance of understanding the entire system, including the interactions between various parts of the organization, in order to improve organizational performance.
> 
> - Today, the systemic approach to management is widely used and recognized as an important perspective for understanding and managing organizations. It has become an integral part of management education and practice, and is used by managers and researchers to analyze and improve organizational performance.
> 
> - The systemic approach in management is important because it *views organizations as complex, interrelated systems*. This approach emphasizes the interdependence of various parts of the organization and the need to consider the organization as a whole. It recognizes that changes in one part of the organization can have ripple effects throughout the system, and that the system as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
> 
> - The systemic approach involves *analyzing the organization's environment, stakeholders, processes, and structures* to understand *how they interact and influence each other*. This enables managers to identify potential sources of dysfunction or inefficiency and develop strategies to improve the overall performance of the organization.
> 
> - By using a systemic approach, managers can *better understand the root causes* of problems and develop solutions that address the underlying issues, rather than just treating the symptoms. This can lead to *more sustainable and effective improvements* in organizational performance over the long term.


# System approach: Understanding complex phenomena

- Systems approach is a way of analyzing and understanding complex phenomena

- It involves looking at a system as a whole and its parts, as well as the relationships and interactions between them or, in other words it involves looking at the big picture and understanding the underlying patterns and structures that drive behaviour and outcomes.

- Recognizes that changing one part of a system can have impacts on other parts of the system and on the system as a whole

- Useful in situations where complex issues and uncertainty exist and where multiple perspectives and disciplines are involved

- Helps to develop more effective and sustainable solutions that consider the entire system, rather than just isolated parts of it

> [!note] 
> 
> - A systems approach, also known as a systemic approach, is a way of analyzing and understanding complex phenomena as *interconnected and interdependent systems*. It involves looking at a system as a whole and its parts, as well as the relationships and interactions between them. This approach recognizes that *changing one part of a system can have impacts on other parts of the system and on the system as a whole*.
>
> - In practical terms, a systems approach can be used in various fields, including *engineering*, *management*, *biology*, *social sciences*, and *ecology*, to help identify problems, develop solutions, and make decisions. It is particularly useful in situations where complex issues and uncertainty exist and where *multiple perspectives* and disciplines are involved. By understanding the underlying patterns and dynamics of a system, a systems approach can help us to develop more effective and sustainable solutions that consider the entire system, rather than just isolated parts of it.


# Important terms related to systems theory

﻿A __system__ is a number of interdependent parts (elements) functioning as a whole for some purpose.

  * __Elements__
  * __Interconnections, relations__
  * __Structure__
  * __Boundaries__
  * __Environment__
  * __Sub-system__
  * __Input__
  * __Output__
  * __Transformative process__
  * __Purpose, function__

- System theory is a framework for understanding complex phenomena that emphasizes the interactions between the elements that make up a system. 

- A system can be thought of as a structured set of interacting elements that work together to achieve a common purpose or function. The "dictionary" of systems theory includes several key concepts that are used to describe and analyze systems:

- **Elements**: The individual components that make up a system. In other words, the parts that interact with each other to achieve a common purpose or function.
- **Interactions/Connections**: The relationships between the elements in a system. These can be positive (when one element's change or action results in a beneficial effect on another element) or negative (when one element's change or action results in a detrimental effect on another element).
- **Structure**: The organization or arrangement of the elements in a system. This refers to how the elements are connected to each other and how they are arranged in terms of hierarchy and complexity.
- **Limits**: The boundaries or constraints that define the scope of the system. These could be physical, economic, or social limits.
- **The Environment**: The larger context in which the system operates. The environment can have a significant impact on the behavior and performance of the system.
- **Subsystems**: Smaller systems that exist within a larger system. Subsystems are themselves systems that contribute to the overall behavior and performance of the larger system.
- **Input**: The resources or information that are needed to operate the system. Input is the flow of material, energy, and information that is required for the system to function.
- **Output**: The products, services, or outcomes that are produced by the system. Output is the result of the transformation process that occurs within the system.
- **Transformation**: The process by which input is converted into output. This involves a series of activities and processes that are designed to achieve the system's intended purpose or function.
- **Purpose/Function**: The intended goal or objective of the system. This guides the system's design, operation, and evaluation.

> These concepts are all interrelated and help to describe and analyze systems from a systemic perspective. Understanding these concepts can help to identify the relationships and dependencies between different parts of a system, which can then be used to improve the system's performance and design more efficient and effective systems.

# Open system model

![[open-system-model.png]]

- An open system is a system that interacts with its environment, meaning that it exchanges matter, energy, and information with the outside world. Examples of open systems include living organisms, social systems, and many industrial and ecological systems. Open systems are influenced by their environment and can adapt and evolve in response to changes in the environment.

- In contrast, a closed system is a system that does not interact with its environment, meaning that it does not exchange matter, energy, or information with the outside world. An example of a closed system is a sealed container, where nothing can enter or exit the container. Closed systems are typically theoretical constructs that are useful for scientific analysis or modeling.

- It's important to note that most real-world systems are not purely open or closed, but exist on a spectrum between the two. Even seemingly closed systems like a sealed container may still exchange heat with the environment or experience small leaks over time. Additionally, many systems can be viewed as open or closed depending on the level of analysis being used. For example, a cell can be viewed as an open system in the context of the nutrients and energy it absorbs from the environment, but as a closed system in terms of its genetic material and organelles.


- With the help of a systemic approach, any **object** or process can be analyzed as __a whole__

# Importance of Relations in a System

- In a system, *everything is interconnected*. It is all about how the relationships and connections between the parts impact the system as a whole. Changing one part of a system will impact the entire system.
- *Every action and decision will have unintended consequences*, so taking the time to analyze a system carefully, instead of rushing to find a “quick and easy fix,” is key.
- If you want to *change a system*, it is *more efficient and impactful to change the interconnections* and purpose or function than it is to change the elements. Changing the rules and relationships can often create a “whole new system.”
- To systems thinkers, there is *no final, definitive answer*. An answer is often the beginning to a new question.


# Organization as an open system

__External environment__ / __Internal environment__

![[external-env.png]]

> Remark: The diagram in the slide only highlights the factors of the microenvironment. There are many more factors in the external environment, and various methods are used to analyze them.

- *An organization can be viewed as an open system*, which means that it interacts with its external environment to receive inputs and transform them into outputs. *The open system perspective emphasizes that an organization is not a closed*, *self-contained entity*, but rather is constantly interacting with its environment to obtain the resources it needs to survive and achieve its goals.

- In an open system, inputs can take many forms, such as *materials, money, information, or people*. These inputs are transformed through various processes within the organization and then released back into the environment as outputs. *Outputs may include products, services, information, or other outcomes* that the organization produces.

- The external environment of an organization can have a significant impact on its performance and success. This environment includes a wide range of factors, such as competitors, customers, suppliers, regulators, social norms, and technological trends. Organizations must monitor and adapt to changes in their external environment to remain competitive and achieve their goals.

- The open system perspective also emphasizes that an organization is not a single, homogeneous entity, but rather is composed of many different subsystems or departments that have their own unique functions and goals. These subsystems are interconnected and interdependent, and changes in one subsystem can have ripple effects throughout the organization.

- By viewing an organization as an open system, managers can *better understand the complex interactions between the organization and its environment*, as well as the *interdependence of the different parts of the organization*. This perspective can help managers to identify potential sources of dysfunction or inefficiency, develop strategies to improve the overall performance of the organization, and adapt to changes in the environment over time.


# Management process as a system

From the perspective of the cybernetic control model, management is the *process of changing the state of the management object* in order to *achieve a specific goal*.

![[goal-subj.png]]

Recall from previous lecture – [[Lecture1#6 fundamental elements of management process|6 fundamental elements of management process]] (Object)

- Management can be viewed as a system, where the process of achieving a goal is *controlled through __feedback loops__*. From the perspective of the cybernetic control model, management involves changing the state of the object being managed in order to achieve a specific goal. This could include, for example, *increasing productivity, improving quality, or reducing costs*.

- In the cybernetic control model, the management process involves a cycle of feedback that is used to control and adjust the system. The feedback loop starts with setting a goal, which is then followed by monitoring the current state of the object of management. Based on the feedback received from monitoring, the system is adjusted to move towards the desired goal. This feedback loop continues until the goal is achieved, or until the goal is revised.

- The cybernetic control model emphasizes the *importance of using feedback* to *adjust and control the system*, rather than simply trying to predict and plan for all possible contingencies. This model recognizes that there will always be uncertainties and changes in the environment that can impact the system, and that *feedback is essential for adapting* and improving the system over time.

- Overall, the cybernetic control model provides a *useful framework for understanding the management* process as a system. By viewing management in this way, managers can more effectively identify and respond to problems, adjust their strategies based on feedback, and work towards achieving their goals.


# Organization as a management object

According to the systemic approach, organizations are rational systems that can be managed.

If organizations can be managed, they are considered as objects of management.

As a management object, organizations can be understood as a set of various sub-systems: resources, existing relationships, ongoing processes, and tools used to achieve goals and objectives.

When applying a systemic approach to organizational management, a significant emphasis is placed on the analysis of the organization's internal and external environments.

If an organization is viewed as a management object, it means that it is seen as a rational system that can be analyzed and managed using standardized tools and methods.

# Welcome to a world made up of organizations!

![](img/Lecture%202%20-%20Systemic%20Approach%20in%20Management5.jpg)

# Classifation of organizations

* Classification of organizations is based on various features, including size, formality, organizational structure, ownership, legal form, functional purpose, etc.
  * __Size__  categories include small, medium, large, and extra large.
  * __Formality__  categories include formal and informal organizations.
  * __Organizational structure __ categories include flat, matrix, linear, and other structures.
  * __Ownership categories__  include private, public, state-owned, and other forms of ownership.
  * __Legal form __ categories include individual company, small partnership, closed joint stock company, and other legal forms.
  * __Functional purpose __ categories include manufacturing companies, wholesale/retail trade companies, financial organizations, infrastructure organizations, clubs, political parties, communities of believers, schools, and other types of organizations.
  * Etc.
* There is no single, unified classification of modern organizations that can fully capture their diversity and complexity.

# Technology in organizations

* _Technology_
  * In the context of organizational management, technology is a specific way of operating an organization, in which the object of work is transformed into a product using tools.
  * It includes both physical and organizational technologies.
  * Both the variety of organizations and the technologies they use are very diverse.

# Classification of technology

Technologies are diverse and constantly evolving, reflecting the wide range of human activities and the need for innovative solutions to various challenges.

Technologies are often classified according to their purpose (information and communication technologies, production technologies, energy technologies, environmental technologies, transportation technologies, construction technologies, bioengineering technologies, etc.).

Other proposals for classification include categorizing technologies:

Information technology (IT) vs. operational technology (OT)

Emerging vs. established technology

Hard vs. soft technology

General-purpose vs. specialized technology

Process vs. product technology

Green Technology vs Conventional Technology

Core Technology vs Support Technology

Disruptive Technology vs Sustaining Technology

# The importance of technology in organizational management

__Improved Efficiency: __ Technology can automate and streamline many business processes, making them more efficient and reducing the need for manual labor.

__Improved Decision-Making: __ Technology provides access to vast amounts of data and information, which can help managers make more informed decisions.

__Improved Communication: __ Technology has revolutionized communication, enabling managers to communicate with employees, customers, and partners more effectively and efficiently.

__Improved Innovation: __ Technology can enable companies to develop new products and services, create new business models, and enter new markets.

__Improved Customer Experience: __ Technology can enable companies to deliver better customer experiences, with features like online ordering, personalized recommendations, and 24/7 customer support.

# What is the organizational environment?

What is the external environment of an organization?

* _External environment_
  * The external environment includes factors that are beyond the control of the organization and have an impact on its activities and results. The organization cannot do much to avoid the influence of these factors. It simply has to adapt to them.
* _External environmental factors:_
  * PESTLE: political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental factors.

![](img/Lecture%202%20-%20Systemic%20Approach%20in%20Management6.png)

What is the internal environment of an organization?

* _Internal environment_
  * The internal environment consists of elements that have an impact on the organization's activities and decision-making. The organization can control these elements. In other words, these elements have an effect, but the organization can change their quality so that their impact is desirable.
* _Internal environmental factors_
  * Material, financial, human, informational, technological resources, organizational culture, organizational structure, goal system, processes, policies, and so on.

# What are analysis methods for internal environment analysis?

- SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

- Resource analysis, including identifying and assessing the availability, quality, and utility of an organization's resources and capabilities

- Value chain analysis, which involves examining an organization's activities and processes to identify areas where it can add value and improve efficiency

- Financial analysis, including examining an organization's financial statements and performance to identify strengths and weaknesses

- Organizational culture analysis, including understanding an organization's values, beliefs, and assumptions, and how they affect its operations and performance

- Employee surveys and feedback, which can help to identify issues and opportunities within the organization's internal environment

- Management information systems (MIS) and information technology (IT) analysis, including assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization's IT systems and processes, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

It's worth noting that some of these methods can also be used for external environment analysis, and that different organizations may choose to focus on different methods depending on their specific needs and goals.

The organisation cannot resolve the problems that exist in the external environment. It can create a strategy to use these problems as an opportunity or neutralise them as a threat.

For finding a solution for these type of problems, the SWOT analysis tool is usually used.

# PESTEL analysis method

* PESTEL stands for Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors.
* It's a strategic analysis tool that helps to identify and analyze the external factors that can affect an organization's business environment.
  * __Political__  factors include government regulations, trade policies, tax policies, and political stability.
  * __Economic__  factors include economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation rates.
  * __Sociocultural__  factors include demographics, cultural trends, lifestyle changes, and social values.
  * __Technological__  factors include technological advancements, innovation, and automation.
  * __Environmental__  factors include climate change, sustainability, and natural resources.
  * __Legal__  factors include employment laws, consumer laws, and regulatory compliance.
* PESTEL analysis is useful in developing business strategies, assessing market opportunities, and identifying potential threats to the organization.

# Finding and applying methods suitable for the analysis of environments

* Quick search on the internet (using relevant keywords in English, it is recommended to use a VPN) related to external and internal environmental analysis (reliable sources such as academic articles, government websites, organizations' public reports, etc.)
* Examples of case studies in academic journals, business publications, consulting firms, and research organization websites
* Collections of management methods (published books, aka ‘manager’s toolkit’ or ‘manager’s handbook’)
* Once you find the methods that seem appropriate for your task:
  * Clarify the conditions for their correct application
  * Consider their advantages and disadvantages
