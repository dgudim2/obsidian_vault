What is a decision?

There is always an alternative! (YES vs NO)

A decision involves  __an irrevocable allocation of resources__ .

A mental commitment or intention is not a decision!

A  __decision__  is a  _choice_  made between two or more available alternatives.

__Reflection__ :

Which of the following represents a  _decision_ ?

# What are management decisions?

* Management decisions
  * Expression of the reaction of the member(s) of the organization to a certain situation (circumstances) of the organization
  * Related to management functions, management objects and other management elements in the organization

# Importance of management decisions and effective decision-making

Management decisions impact the allocation of resources, direction of efforts, and management of risk.

Effective decision-making is critical for organizational success.

Poor decision-making can lead to negative outcomes and even failure.

Effective decision-making requires a range of skills and ongoing learning.

A culture of effective decision-making helps organizations stay competitive and achieve long-term success.

The Decision-Making Process

# The cycle of management decisions

# Decision making-process

* Decision-making process
  * A chain of activities that leads to the choice of one of the alternatives
  * Includes identifying the problem, selecting a solution, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution
* Approaches to decision-making
  * Rational approach
  * Heuristic-intuitive approach
  * Incremental approach
  * Bounded rationality approach
  * and others.

# Rational decision-making process

# What is the rational decision-making model based on?

__Decision-making will be a rational, logical, and consistent choice if:__

the goal is to maximize value

the problem at hand will be clear and unambiguous

the decision-maker(s) will have a clear and specific goal

all possible alternatives will be known, evaluated, and their results (consequences) predicted

the choice will be made to best align with the interests of the organization

# Heuristic-intuitive approach to decision-making

* Heuristic-intuitive approach
  * Characterized by the use of intuition, experience, and rules of thumb, rather than a strictly logical or analytical approach
  * Often used in situations where the decision maker has limited information or time, and needs to make a quick decision
  * Involves a number of different strategies:
    * Use of experience
    * Use of rules of thumb
    * Use of intuition
    * Simplification of information

# Unconscious reasoning in decision-making

Unconscious reasoning is making decisions based on automatic mental processes, rather than conscious deliberation.

Unconscious reasoning can be influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and heuristics.

While it can be useful in certain situations, it can also lead to suboptimal decision-making outcomes.

Techniques like decision-making training and mindfulness practices can help mitigate biases.

Balancing unconscious reasoning with conscious deliberation and critical thinking is important for effective decision-making.

# Incremental decision-making approach

* Incremental decision-making
  * involves breaking down a complex problem into small steps
  * based on a combination of experience, intuition, guesswork, and different method
  * involves several key steps:
    * Identifying the problem
    * Breaking down the problem
    * Addressing each step
    * Evaluating the results

# Bounded rationality approch

* Bounded rationality
  * recognizes the limitations of human cognition and the availability of information
  * acknowledges that decision-making is a complex and uncertain process
  * In practice, decision-makers must work within the constraints of their bounded rationality, using a combination of reason and intuition to make decisions that are "good enough" to meet their needs and objectives

Preferences for outcome

Risks / Uncertainty

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions7.png)

# How is the future influence managed?

* Risk
  * the possibility that something undesirable will happen
* Probability
  * a statistical numerical expression that shows how likely something is to happen
* Uncertainty
  * a situation where there is no information at all about the current situation or the possible consequences or variants of the outcome.
* We face risking when we cannot predict the exact result, but there is enough information to predict the probabilities.

# Distinction between a decision and an outcome

__Quality of outcome__

|  | Bad | Good |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Good | Driving sober and having an accident | Driving sober and arriving safely |
| Bad | Driving drunk and having an accident | Driving drunk and arriving safely |

__Quality of decision__

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions9.png)

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions10.png)

A good decision is one that produces a desired outcome.

A good decision is one that has the highest chance of getting the best outcome.

A good decision is one that has the lowest chance of getting the worst outcome.

Decision-Making Techniques & Tools

__Variety__ : There are a wide range of decision-making techniques and tools available, each with their own strengths and limitations. Some are simple and intuitive, while others are more complex and require significant expertise or resources.

__Applicability__ : The best decision-making techniques and tools will depend on the specific context of the decision, including the level of risk and uncertainty, the availability of resources and data, and the preferences and needs of the decision-makers.

__Benefits__ : Using effective decision-making techniques and tools can help individuals and organizations to save time and resources, reduce risk, increase innovation and creativity, and improve the overall quality of decision-making outcomes.

# Qualitative techniques

Qualitative techniques are decision-making tools that are used to gather and analyze non-numerical data, such as descriptions, narratives, and opinions.

Qualitative techniques are often used in decision-making when there is limited or uncertain data available, or when the decision involves subjective or complex factors that cannot be easily measured with quantitative data.

Using qualitative techniques in decision-making can help decision-makers gain a deeper understanding of complex or uncertain situations, and can provide valuable insights into the attitudes, behaviors, and needs of customers, employees, or other stakeholders.

# Brainstorming

A group is formed and introduced to the purpose of the discussion.

Conditions are created so that each member of the group can communicate with every other member.

Each member is given sufficient time and opportunity to express their opinion.

The session moderator records the ideas presented.

The generated ideas or potential solutions are then evaluated, analyzed, and prioritized.

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions12.jpg)

# Nominal Group Technique (NGT

Definition: The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is a structured process for generating and prioritizing ideas or solutions in a group setting.

Purpose: NGT is typically used when a group needs to make a decision or solve a problem, and when it is important to hear from all group members to ensure a diverse range of perspectives and ideas.

Process: The NGT process typically involves several rounds of idea generation, with each round involving a specific set of activities, including idea generation, clarification, and prioritization.

Idea generation: In the first round, each member of the group generates a set of ideas or solutions to the problem or decision being considered. These ideas are shared with the group without discussion or evaluation.

Clarification: In the second round, each idea is clarified and discussed to ensure that all group members understand the idea and its implications.

Prioritization: In the final round, the group works together to prioritize the ideas based on their relative importance and feasibility. This can be done through a voting process or other methods.

Benefits: NGT can help to ensure that all group members have a voice and are able to contribute their ideas and perspectives. It can also help to generate a wide range of ideas and perspectives, and can lead to better decision-making outcomes.

Limitations: NGT can be time-consuming, and may not work well for groups with strong personalities or when there are power differentials within the group.

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions13.jpg)

# Rules of iterative voting

Ideas are counted

Dividing by 2 and adding 1 is the number of votes each member receives

Each member votes by placing a sticker on the idea

The process is repeated until the number of ideas reaches a minimum of 3

# Yes/No method

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions14.jpg)

Definition: A simple decision-making technique where a group votes "yes" or "no" on a proposal.

Purpose: Efficiently determine the level of agreement or disagreement on a decision.

Process: Group is presented with a proposal, and each member indicates "yes" or "no".

Decision criteria: Can be used with or without specific decision criteria.

Majority rule: Decision made based on majority rule.

Benefits: Quick and simple way to streamline decision-making process.

Limitations: Subject to bias or influence from dominant members, may not generate innovative solutions.

# Quantitive techniques

Quantitative techniques are decision-making tools that rely on numerical data and mathematical models to analyze, interpret, and make decisions.

Quantitative techniques can be used to analyze complex data sets, forecast future trends, and optimize decision-making outcomes.

Quantitative techniques can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of decision-making outcomes, and can be used to test and evaluate different scenarios or options.

Quantitative techniques can be complex and time-consuming to implement, and may require specialized skills or expertise to use effectively.

# Expert evaluation

Expert evaluation methods are part of decision-making theory

Expert evaluation is a problem-solving procedure that seeks to make decisions based on the opinions of specialists

Decisions based on the opinions of multiple experts are more accurate than those based on the opinion of a single expert

Multi-criteria analysis methods are used to process the results, allowing for quantitative and qualitative criteria to be compared

There are many methods used in expert evaluations

# Main steps in expert evaluation

Requirements for expert qualifications are formulated and the necessary number of experts to be surveyed is determined.

Evaluation scale is prepared.

Experts are surveyed, and data is collected.

Compatibility of expert opinions is verified.

Using multi-criteria analysis methods, the results are processed and the best alternative is determined, giving it a numerical expression.

# Group decision-making

* Advantages
  * Diverse perspectives
  * Shared ownership
  * More alternatives
  * Better information sharing

* Disadvantages
  * Time-consuming
  * Potential for conflict
  * Pressure to conform
  * Unequal participation

# Heuristic algorithms

The heuristic algorithm is designed to solve a problem faster and more efficiently than traditional methods by sacrificing optimality, accuracy, or completeness for speed.

Using heuristic algorithms does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, but rather a good enough solution.

# Decision support systems (DSS)

Computerized information systems whose goal is to help people make rational and effective decisions in complex conditions.

Decision support systems do not make decisions themselves, but comprehensively, thoroughly and objectively analyze large amounts of data.

They evaluate the potential consequences of decisions and can suggest alternative solutions.

They present information in a convenient way (such as diagrams, graphs, tables, etc.).

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions16.jpg)

Ethical Considerations in Decision-Making

# Ethical Considerations in Decision-Making

Ethical considerations are an essential part of decision-making and should be approached with seriousness and care.

Ethical decision-making involves recognizing that the choices made may have far-reaching impacts on various stakeholders, and that these must be taken into account.

Decisions should be evaluated based on moral principles such as justice, honesty, and respect for others.

It is crucial to identify and manage any potential biases or conflicts of interest that may influence decision-making.

To promote inclusivity and avoid groupthink, input from diverse perspectives should be sought.

Decisions should be evaluated against ethical frameworks and standards, such as professional codes of conduct or legal requirements.

The long-term consequences of a decision on society and the environment must be considered alongside short-term gains.

The decision-making process and its outcomes should be transparent and accountable.

# Can you entrust the decision to a robot?

# Decision-making errors and biases

Confirmation bias: A tendency to seek out information that supports pre-existing beliefs or opinions, and to ignore information that contradicts them.

Overconfidence bias: The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities, knowledge, or the accuracy of one's judgments.

Anchoring bias: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information received, even if it is irrelevant or incorrect.

Framing effect: The way in which a decision is presented can influence the outcome. People are more likely to choose an option that is presented in a positive light, even if it is not the best choice.

Availability bias: The tendency to make judgments based on readily available information, rather than seeking out all relevant information.
