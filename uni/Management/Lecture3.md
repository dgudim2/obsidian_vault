# What is a decision?

> [!definition] 
> 
> - There is always an alternative! (YES vs NO)
> - A decision involves __an irrevocable allocation of resources__ .
> - A <u>mental commitment</u> or intention is **not** a decision!
> - A __decision__ is a _choice_ made between two or more available alternatives.

**Decision-making** is an essential aspect of our daily lives, and *we consciously or unconsciously make decisions every day*, ranging from what to have for breakfast to which career path to pursue. Making a decision requires critical thinking, data analysis, and consideration of the consequences of the options.

A decision is a process of **selecting** *one option* from two or more alternatives based on *specific criteria*. It involves assessing various possibilities, weighing their pros and cons, and choosing the best course of action that aligns with one's objectives or goals.

In decision-making, there are always *two or more options to choose from*. A decision is made by **evaluating** these options and selecting the best course of action that aligns with one's objectives or goals. It requires making a *conscious choice* between two or more options.

**However**, *not all actions can be considered a decision*. An **impulse** reaction or a **habitual** behavior <u>does not involve the evaluation of options</u> or thought process required for decision-making. For instance, grabbing a candy bar at the checkout counter or brushing your teeth every morning are not decisions but automatic behaviors.

**Similarly**, *stating an intention or making a psychological commitment* to a particular course of action <u>is not a decision</u>. A decision involves committing to an irrevocable assignment of resources towards a particular course of action, such as time, money, or effort. Without this commitment, a psychological commitment or intention is just a preference or desire.

Furthermore, a decision is a critical process that requires conscious and thoughtful evaluation of available options. It is not a random or impulsive behavior. Decision-making involves considering the possible consequences of each option and weighing the pros and cons of each alternative, taking into account factors such as risk, uncertainty, and opportunity costs.

**In conclusion**, a decision involves a commitment to an *irrevocable assignment of resources* towards a specific course of action. It requires a thoughtful evaluation of available options and a *conscious choice between two or more alternatives*. Understanding the nature of decision-making can help us make better choices and achieve our goals.

- Examples of situations where **we have a decision**:
	- Choosing between two job offers based on salary, work schedule, benefits, and location.
	- Deciding which university to attend based on academics, location, cost, and campus culture.
	- Determining which type of investment to make based on risk tolerance, potential return, and the investment horizon.
	- Selecting a medical treatment based on cost, effectiveness, and side effects.

- Examples of situations when **we do not have a decision**:
	- Getting up every morning to go to work. It is an automatic behavior that does not require a conscious evaluation of options.
	- Reaching for a glass of water when feeling thirsty. It is an impulsive action that does not involve a thoughtful decision-making process.
	- Having a preference for a particular type of food. It is a personal choice but not a decision because it does not involve a commitment of resources.
	- Stating a general intention to travel to Europe without any specific plan or commitment. It is not a decision because it does not involve a specific course of action or a commitment of resources.

# What are management decisions?

* Management decisions
  * Expression of the reaction of the member(s) of the organization to a certain situation (circumstances) of the organization
  * Related to management functions, management objects and other management elements in the organization

A **management decision** refers to the choices and actions taken by an organization's management to achieve specific goals and objectives. It is an expression of the reaction of a member(s) of an organization to a particular situation or circumstances. Management decision-making is a crucial process in achieving an organization's goals.

**Management decisions** are made at various levels of the organization, from entry-level managers to top-level managers. These decisions are related to management functions, management objects, and other management elements within the organization.

**Management functions**, including planning, organizing, leading, and controlling, are all geared towards making decisions that ensure the organization is on track to achieve its objectives.

The **planning** function of management involves **identifying** *goals* and *objectives* and determining the *best course of action* to achieve them. This process requires making decisions on which strategies, tactics, and resources to use to achieve the desired outcome. Planning also requires evaluating different alternatives and making decisions based on the potential impact they will have on the organization.

The **organizing** function of management is concerned with *creating the necessary structure* to achieve the organization's goals. 
This involves decisions about the *allocation of resources*, the design of job roles, and the *delegation of authority*. Organizing also requires decisions about the *optimal use of technology* and systems to improve efficiency and productivity.

The **leading** function of management involves *guiding and directing the people* within the organization to achieve its goals. This requires *decisions about how to motivate* and *inspire* employees, how to *develop talent* within the organization, and how to manage conflicts that arise.

The **controlling** function of management is focused on monitoring and measuring progress towards achieving the organization's goals. This requires making decisions about performance standards, measurements, and corrective action when goals are not being met.

In addition to management functions, decisions are also **related to management objects**, such as the *allocation of resources*, the *design of products*, and the *management of finances*. 

Decisions are also related to *other management elements* within an organization, such as the *organizational culture*, the ethics and values of the organization, and the role of leadership in shaping the direction of the organization.

# Importance of management decisions and effective decision-making

- Management decisions impact the allocation of resources, direction of efforts, and management of risk.
- Effective decision-making is critical for organizational success.
- Poor decision-making can lead to negative outcomes and even failure.
- Effective decision-making requires a range of skills and ongoing learning.
- A culture of effective decision-making helps organizations stay competitive and achieve long-term success.

# Classification of Management Decisions

* **Focus**
  * Economic, social, technical, and organizational decisions
* **Area or management object**
  * Main activities, sales, marketing, finance, and personnel decisions
* **Level of control**
  * Regulatory, indicative, and informative decisions
* **Level of management**

> [!note] 
> 
> Management decisions can be classified *in various ways* based on different criteria. The classification of management decisions provides a framework for understanding the *different types of decisions* that managers need to make in different contexts. Below are some common ways of classifying management decisions:
> 
> **Economic**, **social**, **technical**, and **organizational** decisions: This classification refers to the *different types of decisions* that managers make based on their focus. Economic decisions relate to financial performance and resources, *__social__ decisions* relate to employees, stakeholders, and the community, *__technical__ decisions* relate to technology, and *__organizational__ decisions* relate to the structure, policies, and procedures of the organization.
> 
> **Main activities**, **sales**, **marketing**, **finance**, and **personnel** decisions: This classification refers to the *different areas of the organization* that managers focus on when making decisions. Main activities decisions are related to the primary operations of the organization, while sales, marketing, finance, and personnel decisions relate to the specific functions of the organization.
> 
> **Regulatory**, **indicative**, and **informative** decisions: This classification refers to the different types of decisions that managers make based on the level of control they have. *__Regulatory__ decisions* are *mandatory decisions made by the government* or other regulatory bodies. Indicative decisions are recommendations or suggestions made by external entities, and informative decisions are decisions made based on information provided by internal or external sources.
> 
> **Strategic**, **tactical**, and **operational** decisions: This classification refers to the level of management that makes decisions. Strategic decisions are made by top-level management and are focused on the long-term objectives of the organization. Tactical decisions are made by middle-level management and are focused on the short-term goals of the organization. Operational decisions are made by lower-level management and are focused on the day-to-day operations of the organization.
> 
> **Unstructured**, **structured**, and **clearly structured** decisions: This classification refers to the level of complexity of the decision-making process. Unstructured decisions are made when there is no clear framework or process for making decisions. Structured decisions are made when there is a clear process and framework for making decisions. Clearly structured decisions are made when there is a specific algorithm or formula for making decisions.
> 
> **Very complex**, **medium complexity**, and **templated** decisions: This classification refers to the level of difficulty of the decision-making process. Very complex decisions are made when the decision requires extensive analysis, research, and evaluation. Medium complexity decisions are made when the decision requires moderate analysis and research. Templated decisions are made when the decision can be made based on standard procedures or guidelines.
> 
> **Programmable** and **non-programmable** decisions: This classification refers to the degree to which decisions can be automated. Programmable decisions are those that can be automated through the use of technology or software. Non-programmable decisions require human intervention and cannot be automated.
> 
> **Routine**, **adaptive**, and **innovative** decisions: This classification refers to the degree of novelty of the decision-making process. Routine decisions are made when the decision is a common occurrence in the organization. Adaptive decisions are made when the decision requires a modification of the existing processes. Innovative decisions are made when the decision requires a significant change in the processes or products of the organization.
> 
> **Quantitative** and **qualitative** decisions: This classification refers to the data and information used in the decision-making process. Quantitative decisions are made based on numerical data and analysis, while qualitative decisions are made based on subjective or non-numerical data.
> 
> **Verbal**, **paper**, and **digital** decisions: This classification refers to the medium of communication of the decision. Verbal decisions are made through spoken communication, paper decisions are made through written communication, and digital decisions are made through electronic communication.
>
>> [!tldr] 
>> 
>> In conclusion, the classification of management decisions provides a framework for understanding the different types of decisions that managers make in different contexts. The classification allows managers to identify the type of decision that needs to be made and to choose the appropriate tools and processes to make the decision. By understanding the classification of management decisions, managers can develop better decision-making processes that are appropriate to the situation.

# What types of problems are addressed at different levels of management?

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions3.png)

Different levels of management address different types of problems. The level of structure and the type of decision-making that is required to address the problems also varies. 

- Here are some examples:
	- **Unstructured problems**: These are problems that are *complex and have no clear solution*. They require *creativity*, *analysis*, and *judgment* to address. Unstructured problems are typically addressed at the highest level of management, such as by the CEO or top executives. Examples of unstructured problems include developing a long-term strategy for the organization, entering a new market, or responding to a major crisis.
	- **Structured problems**: These are problems that have a *clear and straightforward solution*. They require a *systematic approach* to solve. Structured problems are typically addressed at the *middle and lower levels of management*, such as by supervisors, managers, and team leaders. Examples of structured problems include managing inventory levels, scheduling employee shifts, or calculating payroll.
	- **Programmed decisions**: These are decisions that are made *routinely* and *require minimal analysis*. They are typically based on established rules, procedures, and policies. Programmed decisions are typically made at the *lower levels of management*, such as by front-line employees. Examples of programmed decisions include *approving employee vacation requests*, restocking inventory when supplies run low, or conducting regular safety inspections.
	- **Non-programmed decisions**: These are decisions that are *unique* and *require a more complex analysis*. They typically involve a higher level of risk and uncertainty. Non-programmed decisions are typically made at the *higher levels of management*, such as by managers and executives. Examples of non-programmed decisions include deciding whether to *launch a new product*, choosing a supplier for a major project, or responding to a sudden market disruption.

> [!tldr] 
> 
> In summary, different levels of management address different types of problems, and the level of structure and type of decision-making that is required to address the problems vary accordingly. By understanding these differences, managers can better allocate resources and make informed decisions to address the needs of their organization.

# The cycle of management decisions

![[management-cycle.png]]

- The cycle of management decisions is a process that involves the **preparation of the decision**, **decision making**, and **implementation** of the decision.

- The first step in the cycle of management decisions is the **preparation** of the decision. This involves *identifying the problem*, *gathering information*, and *analyzing the available data*. It is essential to define the scope of the decision and establish clear decision criteria to ensure that the decision-making process is focused and effective.

- The second step is the **decision-making** process. This involves evaluating the available options and selecting the best alternative based on the decision criteria established in the preparation phase. The decision-making process could involve a rational-analytical approach or a heuristic-intuitive approach, depending on the complexity of the decision and the nature of the problem.

- The third and final step in the cycle of management decisions is the **implementation** of the decision. This involves *putting the decision into action* and *allocating the necessary resources* to achieve the desired outcomes. It is essential to communicate the decision to the relevant stakeholders and ensure that the implementation process is consistent with the decision made.

- The cycle of management decisions is a *continuous process* that enables organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their decisions and make adjustments if necessary. It is *essential to monitor* the implementation process and evaluate the results to determine the effectiveness of the decision. This information could be used to inform future decisions and improve the decision-making process.

# Decision making-process

* Decision-making process
  * A chain of activities that leads to the choice of one of the alternatives
  * Includes identifying the problem, selecting a solution, and evaluating the effectiveness of the solution
* Approaches to decision-making
  * Rational approach
  * Heuristic-intuitive approach
  * Incremental approach
  * Bounded rationality approach
  * and others.

- The decision-making process is a *chain of activities* that leads to the choice of one of the alternatives. It includes **identifying** the problem, **selecting a solution**, and **evaluating the effectiveness** of the solution. The decision-making process is an essential aspect an organization's success.

- There are several different approaches to decision-making that managers can use to make effective decisions. Here are some of the most common approaches:
	- [[#Rational decision-making process|Rational Approach]]: This approach involves *identifying the problem* or opportunity, gathering information, identifying alternatives, evaluating alternatives based on a set of criteria, selecting the best alternative, and implementing and monitoring the decision. The rational approach assumes that decision makers have complete and accurate information, and can evaluate alternatives objectively.
	- [[#Heuristic-intuitive approach to decision-making|Heuristic-Intuitive Approach]]: This approach involves *making decisions* based on intuition, or a "*gut feeling*," rather than a rational or objective analysis. The intuitive approach assumes that decision-makers have a *high level of expertise* and experience, and can make good decisions based on their intuition.
	- [[#Incremental decision-making approach|Incremental Approach]]: This approach involves making decisions *based on small, incremental changes* or adjustments, rather than large-scale changes. The incremental approach assumes that decision-making is an ongoing and iterative process, where decisions are made based on feedback and continuous evaluation.
	- [[#Bounded rationality approach]]: The bounded rationality approach acknowledges the limitations of decision-making, while also emphasizing *the importance of making decisions* that are appropriate and effective within the available information and cognitive capacity of decision-makers.

# Rational decision-making process

A model of **rational decision-making process** is a structured approach to making informed and objective decisions. It is a systematic process that involves identifying the problem, gathering information, evaluating the alternatives, and selecting the best solution based on the decision criteria.

The rational decision-making process typically involves six steps:
- **Identifying the problem**: This involves recognizing the issue or challenge that needs to be addressed. The problem could be a gap between the current and desired state of the organization, a specific challenge that needs to be resolved, or an opportunity that needs to be exploited.
- **Gathering information**: Once the problem has been identified, it is essential to gather relevant data and information that could inform the decision-making process. This could include both internal and external sources of information.
- **Identifying decision criteria**: This step involves defining the factors that need to be considered when making a decision. The decision criteria could include financial, ethical, or strategic considerations.
- **Generating alternatives**: This step involves generating different options or alternatives to address the problem. It is important to consider a range of alternatives to ensure that the decision is well-informed and objective.
- **Evaluating alternatives**: This step involves analyzing the alternatives based on the decision criteria identified in step 3. This could involve the use of a decision matrix or other decision-making tools to evaluate the alternatives.
- **Selecting the best solution**: Once the alternatives have been evaluated, the next step is to select the best solution based on the decision criteria. This involves identifying the option that best addresses the problem and aligns with the goals and objectives of the organization.

The model of rational decision-making process is a structured approach that enables organizations to make informed and objective decisions. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex problems that require careful analysis and evaluation of different alternatives. By following a structured decision-making process, organizations can ensure that decisions are well-informed, objective, and aligned with their goals and objectives.

> In conclusion, the model of rational decision-making process is a *systematic approach to making informed and objective decisions*. It involves six steps, including identifying the problem, gathering information, identifying decision criteria, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and selecting the best solution. By following this structured approach, organizations can make effective decisions that lead to success.

## What is the rational decision-making model based on?

__Decision-making will be a rational, logical, and consistent choice if:__

- The goal is to maximize value
- The problem at hand will be clear and unambiguous
- The decision-maker(s) will have a clear and specific goal
- All possible alternatives will be known, evaluated, and their results (consequences) predicted
- The choice will be made to best align with the interests of the organization

> [!note] 
> 
> - A decision is considered rational when it is made in a *logical and consistent* manner, and the aim is to maximize value. This means that the decision maker(s) have *thoroughly evaluated all available options*, considered their potential outcomes and selected the best alternative based on a clear and specific goal.
> 
> - A rational decision is also made when the problem at hand is *clear and unambiguous*, and the decision maker(s) understand the situation they are facing. This allows them to gather all necessary information, analyze it effectively, and make an informed decision.
> 
> - Another factor that contributes to rational decision-making is knowing all possible alternatives, their evaluation, and predicting their results or consequences. This enables the decision maker(s) to consider all available options, and choose the one that best aligns with the goals and objectives of the organization.
> 
> - Finally, a decision is rational when it is made in the best interest of the organization. This means that the decision maker(s) have considered the long-term consequences of the decision and made the choice that is most beneficial to the organization.

# Heuristic-intuitive approach to decision-making

* Heuristic-intuitive approach
  * Characterized by the use of **intuition**, **experience**, and **rules of thumb**, rather than a strictly logical or analytical approach
  * Often used in situations where the decision maker has limited information or time, and needs to make a quick decision
  * Involves a number of different strategies:
    * Use of experience
    * Use of rules of thumb
    * Use of intuition
    * Simplification of information

> [!note] 
> 
> - The heuristic-intuitive approach to decision-making is a type of decision-making process that is characterized by the use of intuition, experience, and rules of thumb, rather than a strictly logical or analytical approach. This approach is often used in situations where the decision maker has limited information or time, and needs to make a quick decision.
> 
> - The heuristic-intuitive approach involves a number of different strategies, including:
> 	- Use of **experience**: Decision makers rely on their *past experiences* and knowledge to make decisions. This allows them to quickly evaluate the situation and make a decision based on what has worked in the past.
> 	- Use of **rules of thumb**: Decision makers use *heuristics or rules of thumb to make quick decisions*. For example, a person may decide to buy a product based on the brand name, without conducting a thorough analysis of the product's features.
> 	- Use of **intuition**: Decision makers rely on their *instincts and intuition* to make decisions. This involves taking a "*gut feeling*" approach to decision-making, rather than relying on a strict analysis of the available information.
> 	- **Simplification** of information: Decision makers simplify complex information into more manageable chunks, which allows them to make a quicker and easier decision.
> 
> - While the heuristic-intuitive approach can be useful in certain situations, it can also be prone to errors and biases. For example, decision makers may rely too heavily on past experiences or rules of thumb, without taking into account new or changing circumstances. This can lead to incorrect or ineffective decisions.
> 
> - By balancing the heuristic-intuitive approach with a more analytical and *logical approach*, decision makers can make *more informed and effective decisions*.

# Unconscious reasoning in decision-making

- Unconscious reasoning is making decisions based on automatic mental processes, rather than conscious deliberation.

- Unconscious reasoning can be influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and heuristics.

- While it can be useful in certain situations, it can also lead to suboptimal decision-making outcomes.

- Techniques like decision-making training and mindfulness practices can help mitigate biases.

- Balancing unconscious reasoning with conscious deliberation and critical thinking is important for effective decision-making.

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions4.png)

> [!note] 
> 
> - **Unconscious reasoning** is a decision-making process that is based on automatic mental processes, rather than conscious deliberation. This approach can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as cognitive biases, emotional factors, and the use of mental shortcuts or heuristics.
> 
> - **Cognitive biases**, including confirmation bias, availability bias, and anchoring bias, can lead to suboptimal decision-making outcomes by distorting our perceptions and judgments. Emotional factors, such as fear, excitement, or anxiety, can also affect our perception of a decision and our willingness to take risks.
> 
> - **Heuristics**, or mental shortcuts, can help individuals make decisions more quickly and efficiently, even if these shortcuts are not always accurate or optimal. While unconscious reasoning may seem to be a less rational and objective approach to decision-making, it can also be useful in certain situations, such as when time or resources are limited, or when creative solutions are needed.
> 
> - To mitigate the potential negative effects of unconscious reasoning, *decision-making training and mindfulness practices* can help individuals become more aware of their own biases and mental processes, and can lead to better decision-making outcomes. It is also important to balance unconscious reasoning with conscious deliberation and critical thinking, especially when making important decisions that could have significant consequences. By balancing unconscious and conscious reasoning, individuals can make the best decisions and achieve their desired outcomes.

# Incremental decision-making approach

* Incremental decision-making
  * involves breaking down a complex problem into small steps
  * based on a combination of experience, intuition, guesswork, and different method
  * involves several key steps:
    * Identifying the problem
    * Breaking down the problem
    * Addressing each step
    * Evaluating the results

> [!note] 
> 
> - An incremental decision-making model is a type of decision-making process that involves *breaking down a complex problem into small steps*, and addressing each step individually. This approach is based on a combination of experience, intuition, guesswork, and different methods.
> 
> - Most people use an incremental approach to decision-making on a daily basis, without even realizing it. This approach is often used to deal with routine problems, such as making coffee or getting dressed. The steps involved in these decisions usually don't require a lot of planning, and problems can be tackled one at a time as they arise.
> 
> - The incremental decision-making model involves several key steps, including:
> 	- **Identifying the problem**: The decision maker identifies the problem or issue that needs to be addressed.
> 	- **Breaking down the problem**: The problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable steps.
> 	- **Addressing each step**: Each step is addressed individually, using a combination of experience, intuition, and different methods.
> 	- **Evaluating the results**: The decision maker evaluates the results of each step and adjusts their approach as needed.
> 
> - While the incremental decision-making model can be useful for addressing routine problems, it *may not be the best approach for more complex or strategic decisions*. This is because an incremental approach may not take into account the long-term implications of a decision, or the interactions between different parts of a complex problem.

# Bounded rationality approach

* Bounded rationality
  * recognizes the limitations of human cognition and the availability of information
  * acknowledges that decision-making is a complex and uncertain process
  * In practice, decision-makers must work within the constraints of their bounded rationality, using a combination of reason and intuition to make decisions that are "good enough" to meet their needs and objectives

> [!note] 
> 
> - Bounded rationality is a concept developed by economist Herbert Simon to describe the limitations of human decision-making. According to Simon, while humans are rational decision makers, their rationality is limited or bounded by their cognitive and environmental limitations.
> 
> - Bounded rationality suggests that decision makers do not have access to all of the information needed to make an optimal decision, and therefore *must rely on heuristics*, shortcuts, and simplified models to make a decision that is "good enough" to satisfy their needs. These decisions are often made under time pressure and uncertainty, and can be influenced by emotions, biases, and other factors.
> 
> - For example, in the context of consumer decision-making, bounded rationality suggests that consumers *do not evaluate every option available* to them when making a purchase decision, but instead rely on mental shortcuts, such as brand reputation, price, or packaging, to make a quick and satisfactory decision.
> 
> - In the context of organizational decision-making, bounded rationality suggests that *managers do not have access to all of the information needed to make an optimal decision*, but instead rely on heuristics and simplified models to make a decision that is "good enough" for the organization's needs. This can lead to decisions that are less than optimal, but are still satisfactory for the organization's goals.

# How is the future influence managed?

* Risk
  * the possibility that something undesirable will happen
* Probability
  * a statistical numerical expression that shows how likely something is to happen
* Uncertainty
  * a situation where there is no information at all about the current situation or the possible consequences or variants of the outcome.
* We face risking when we cannot predict the exact result, but there is enough information to predict the probabilities.

> [!note] 
> 
> - Risk, probability, and uncertainty are concepts that are closely related to decision making. Here is an explanation of each concept and some examples:
> 	- Risk: Risk refers to the *possibility that something undesirable will happen*. It is a measure of the potential for loss or harm that may result from a particular decision or action. The concept of risk is important in decision making because it helps decision makers to evaluate the potential outcomes of their decisions and to take steps to mitigate or avoid risks. For example, a company might decide to invest in a new product line, but will need to carefully evaluate the risks associated with the investment, such as potential losses, market competition, and changing consumer tastes.
> 
> 	- Probability: Probability is a *statistical numerical expression* that shows how likely something is to happen. It is a measure of the likelihood of a particular event occurring, expressed as a value between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the event is impossible, and 1 meaning the event is certain to occur. Probability is an important concept in decision making because it helps decision makers to assess the likelihood of different outcomes, and to make informed choices based on that assessment. For example, an investor may decide to invest in a particular stock based on the probability that it will increase in value over time.
> 
> 	- Uncertainty: Uncertainty is a *situation where there is absolutely no information either* about the current state or about possible consequences or variants of consequences. It is a lack of knowledge or information about a particular situation, which makes it difficult to predict the outcome of a decision. Uncertainty is an important concept in decision making because it can make it difficult to evaluate the potential outcomes of a decision, and to make informed choices. For example, a business may be uncertain about the outcome of a new marketing campaign, and may need to carefully evaluate the risks and benefits before making a decision.

# Distinction between a decision and an outcome

Quality of outcome ->>

|             |      |                 Bad                  |               Good                |
| ----------- |:----:|:------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| Quality     | Good | Driving sober and having an accident | Driving sober and arriving safely |
| Of decision | Bad  | Driving drunk and having an accident | Driving drunk and arriving safely |

- A good decision is one that produces a desired outcome.
- A good decision is one that has the highest chance of getting the best outcome.
- A good decision is one that has the lowest chance of getting the worst outcome.


<u>- A good decision does not guarantee a good outcome!</u>

- Decision quality and outcome quality are two important measures that are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a decision-making process. Here is an explanation of each concept:
	- **Decision Quality**: Decision quality refers to the extent to which a decision is well-informed, well-reasoned, and well-executed. It is a measure of the effectiveness of the decision-making process, rather than the outcome of the decision. A high-quality decision is one that is based on a thorough analysis of all available information, considers all relevant factors, and is made with clear and well-defined criteria. Decision quality is important because it helps decision makers to make informed choices and to take action that is in the best interests of their organization or stakeholders.
	- **Outcome Quality**: Outcome quality refers to the extent to which a decision achieves its intended goals and produces positive results. It is a measure of the effectiveness of the decision itself, rather than the decision-making process. A high-quality outcome is one that achieves the desired results and has a positive impact on the organization or stakeholders. Outcome quality is important because it helps decision makers to evaluate the effectiveness of their decisions and to identify areas for improvement.

- It is important to note that decision quality and outcome quality *are not always directly correlated*. A high-quality decision does not always guarantee a high-quality outcome, as there may be external factors that impact the outcome. Similarly, a high-quality outcome does not always indicate a high-quality decision, as the outcome may have been achieved through luck or other external factors.

# Decision-Making Techniques & Tools

__Variety__ : There are a wide range of decision-making techniques and tools available, each with their own strengths and limitations. Some are simple and intuitive, while others are more complex and require significant expertise or resources.

__Applicability__: The best decision-making techniques and tools will depend on the specific context of the decision, including the level of risk and uncertainty, the availability of resources and data, and the preferences and needs of the decision-makers.

__Benefits__ : Using effective decision-making techniques and tools can help individuals and organizations to save time and resources, reduce risk, increase innovation and creativity, and improve the overall quality of decision-making outcomes.

## Qualitative techniques

Qualitative techniques are decision-making tools that are used to gather and analyze non-numerical data, such as descriptions, narratives, and opinions.

Qualitative techniques are often used in decision-making when there is limited or uncertain data available, or when the decision involves subjective or complex factors that cannot be easily measured with quantitative data.

Using qualitative techniques in decision-making can help decision-makers gain a deeper understanding of complex or uncertain situations, and can provide valuable insights into the attitudes, behaviors, and needs of customers, employees, or other stakeholders.

# Brainstorming

A group is formed and introduced to the purpose of the discussion.

Conditions are created so that each member of the group can communicate with every other member.

Each member is given sufficient time and opportunity to express their opinion.

The session moderator records the ideas presented.

The generated ideas or potential solutions are then evaluated, analyzed, and prioritized.

# Nominal Group Technique (NGT

Definition: The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is a structured process for generating and prioritizing ideas or solutions in a group setting.

Purpose: NGT is typically used when a group needs to make a decision or solve a problem, and when it is important to hear from all group members to ensure a diverse range of perspectives and ideas.

Process: The NGT process typically involves several rounds of idea generation, with each round involving a specific set of activities, including idea generation, clarification, and prioritization.

Idea generation: In the first round, each member of the group generates a set of ideas or solutions to the problem or decision being considered. These ideas are shared with the group without discussion or evaluation.

Clarification: In the second round, each idea is clarified and discussed to ensure that all group members understand the idea and its implications.

Prioritization: In the final round, the group works together to prioritize the ideas based on their relative importance and feasibility. This can be done through a voting process or other methods.

Benefits: NGT can help to ensure that all group members have a voice and are able to contribute their ideas and perspectives. It can also help to generate a wide range of ideas and perspectives, and can lead to better decision-making outcomes.

Limitations: NGT can be time-consuming, and may not work well for groups with strong personalities or when there are power differentials within the group.

# Rules of iterative voting

Ideas are counted

Dividing by 2 and adding 1 is the number of votes each member receives

Each member votes by placing a sticker on the idea

The process is repeated until the number of ideas reaches a minimum of 3

# Yes/No method

![](img/Lecture%203%20-%20Management%20Decisions14.jpg)

Definition: A simple decision-making technique where a group votes "yes" or "no" on a proposal.

Purpose: Efficiently determine the level of agreement or disagreement on a decision.

Process: Group is presented with a proposal, and each member indicates "yes" or "no".

Decision criteria: Can be used with or without specific decision criteria.

Majority rule: Decision made based on majority rule.

Benefits: Quick and simple way to streamline decision-making process.

Limitations: Subject to bias or influence from dominant members, may not generate innovative solutions.

# Quantitive techniques

Quantitative techniques are decision-making tools that rely on numerical data and mathematical models to analyze, interpret, and make decisions.

Quantitative techniques can be used to analyze complex data sets, forecast future trends, and optimize decision-making outcomes.

Quantitative techniques can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of decision-making outcomes, and can be used to test and evaluate different scenarios or options.

Quantitative techniques can be complex and time-consuming to implement, and may require specialized skills or expertise to use effectively.

# Expert evaluation

Expert evaluation methods are part of decision-making theory

Expert evaluation is a problem-solving procedure that seeks to make decisions based on the opinions of specialists

Decisions based on the opinions of multiple experts are more accurate than those based on the opinion of a single expert

Multi-criteria analysis methods are used to process the results, allowing for quantitative and qualitative criteria to be compared

There are many methods used in expert evaluations

# Main steps in expert evaluation

Requirements for expert qualifications are formulated and the necessary number of experts to be surveyed is determined.

Evaluation scale is prepared.

Experts are surveyed, and data is collected.

Compatibility of expert opinions is verified.

Using multi-criteria analysis methods, the results are processed and the best alternative is determined, giving it a numerical expression.

# Group decision-making

* Advantages
  * Diverse perspectives
  * Shared ownership
  * More alternatives
  * Better information sharing

* Disadvantages
  * Time-consuming
  * Potential for conflict
  * Pressure to conform
  * Unequal participation

# Heuristic algorithms

The heuristic algorithm is designed to solve a problem faster and more efficiently than traditional methods by sacrificing optimality, accuracy, or completeness for speed.

Using heuristic algorithms does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, but rather a good enough solution.

# Decision support systems (DSS)

Computerized information systems whose goal is to help people make rational and effective decisions in complex conditions.

Decision support systems do not make decisions themselves, but comprehensively, thoroughly and objectively analyze large amounts of data.

They evaluate the potential consequences of decisions and can suggest alternative solutions.

They present information in a convenient way (such as diagrams, graphs, tables, etc.).

Ethical Considerations in Decision-Making

# Ethical Considerations in Decision-Making

Ethical considerations are an essential part of decision-making and should be approached with seriousness and care.

Ethical decision-making involves recognizing that the choices made may have far-reaching impacts on various stakeholders, and that these must be taken into account.

Decisions should be evaluated based on moral principles such as justice, honesty, and respect for others.

It is crucial to identify and manage any potential biases or conflicts of interest that may influence decision-making.

To promote inclusivity and avoid groupthink, input from diverse perspectives should be sought.

Decisions should be evaluated against ethical frameworks and standards, such as professional codes of conduct or legal requirements.

The long-term consequences of a decision on society and the environment must be considered alongside short-term gains.

The decision-making process and its outcomes should be transparent and accountable.

# Can you entrust the decision to a robot?

# Decision-making errors and biases

Confirmation bias: A tendency to seek out information that supports pre-existing beliefs or opinions, and to ignore information that contradicts them.

Overconfidence bias: The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities, knowledge, or the accuracy of one's judgments.

Anchoring bias: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information received, even if it is irrelevant or incorrect.

Framing effect: The way in which a decision is presented can influence the outcome. People are more likely to choose an option that is presented in a positive light, even if it is not the best choice.

Availability bias: The tendency to make judgments based on readily available information, rather than seeking out all relevant information.
