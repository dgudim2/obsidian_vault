# What is planning as a management function?

* Planning
  * is the definition of goals, the selection of measures to achieve those goals, and the creation of a rational sequence of actions to achieve them
  * is the anticipation of goals, measures, and actions required to achieve those goals
  * is the systematic development of action programs aimed at reaching agreed-upon business objectives by the process of analyzing, evaluating, and selecting among the opportunities which are foreseen

# It is important to note that...

Planning is a management function that links goals, resources, and results, and is closely related to the function of controlling

From a practical management perspective, planning involves two important aspects – goals and plans

Planning is a priority function among other management functions

The planning process is dynamic, iterative, ongoing, and constantly reviewed

# What can be planned?

Reduces uncertainty, improves adaptability

Facilitates communication, coordination

Etc.

# Stages of the planning process

Where do organizational goals come from?

# What defines the direction of the organization?

* Mission, vision, and values are components of an organization's core strength or target orientation
* These statements together:
  * establish the direction of the organization
  * inform stakeholders about current and future strategies
  * allow for the formulation of measurable goals and objectives that can be used to assess the success of the organization.

# Organizational target orientation

* Mission
  * The main purpose or reason for which the organization exists
  * The formulation of the mission statement is important because it helps to focus the attention and efforts of organization members on a common purpose
* Vision
  * An inspiring, emotional statement about the organization in the future, conveying what the organization would like to be in its ideal form
  * The formulation of the vision statement helps to understand what the organization hopes to become in the future
* Values
  * Reflect the core principles and ethics of the organization

# Relationship between target orientation and organizational goals

* You SEE a Vision
  * a verbal image of what we ultimately want to achieve
* You HAVE a Mission
  * your business purpose and market sector
* You BELIEVE in Values
  * your moral compass and expected behaviours
* You PURSUE Goals
  * the results we choose to accomplish
* You ACHIEVE Objectives
  * measurable targets along the path to our goals

# Formulation of a vision

_What are we trying to achieve?_

_What impact do we want to make?_

_What makes us unique?_

_Who is the vision statement intended for?_

A good vision statement is:

Looking forward (3, 5, or even 10 years)

Motivating and inspiring

Reflecting the company culture and core values

Anticipating organizational growth

Easily communicable

![](img/Lecture%204%20-%20Planning6.jpg)

![](img/Lecture%204%20-%20Planning7.png)

_What do we do [today]?_

_Who do we serve?_

_How do we do it?_

A good mission statement should reflect:

A targeted customer segment

Value provided by the organization (product or service)

The uniqueness of the organization

Additionally, a well-formulated mission statement explains how the vision will be realized.

# Core values of an organization

_What do we support?_

_What attracts people to this organization?_

_What makes our work culture unique?_

_What do we do better and need to improve better than anyone else?_

_How will we conduct our operations to achieve our mission and vision?_

* Values are beliefs that underlie the vision and mission.
* They serve as a moral compass and guide the expected behavior in achieving the vision and mission.
* The statements of values may include elements such as
  * honesty in business
  * commitment to employees
  * product quality
  * environmental protection
  * innovative ideas
  * continuous learning

![](img/Lecture%204%20-%20Planning13.png)

Target orientation statements must be:

Established in the organizational culture

Understood by different levels of the organizational hierarchy

Regularly reviewed and adjusted

Written down to ensure clarity and understanding of what and why things are done

# Organizational goals

* __Organizational goals__
  * These are the focus of an open management system. The inputs, processes, and outputs all exist to achieve organizational goals.
  * Well-developed organizational goals reflect the purpose of the organization, i.e. they naturally flow from the organization's mission.
  * They must be harmonized with each other, constructive, specific, and sufficiently challenging to demand focus but realistically achievable.

# How to formulate goals properly?

Using action verbs in formulation

When there are many goals, it is necessary to structure them (hierarchize), i.e. create a tree of goals (Goal Tree).

Apply the SMART method

![](img/Lecture%204%20-%20Planning21.png)

# Objectives and tasks

Objectives are specific, measurable statements that outline what needs to be achieved and when. They should be SMART.

Goals provide direction for an organization, while objectives provide the specific steps needed to achieve those goals.

Objectives include targets, or metrics/KPIs, used to measure progress towards the goal.

Objectives can also include tasks with varying degrees of task structure, which refers to the level of detail in job descriptions and procedures.

__I will obtain a job as a junior programmer within three months after graduating with my Bachelor Degree.__

Specific: The goal of becoming a junior programmer is well-defined

Measurable: Success can be measured by the number of applications, interviews and job offers.

Achievable: The goal setter will have the appropriate degree for the job.

Relevant: The goal setter is planning to get a job in the ITC industry after getting an education degree.

Time-based: The goal setter has set a deadline to achieve their objective within the three months following graduation.

__S__ (specific) – states exactly what you need to achieve. Make your goals specific and narrow for more effective planning.

__M__ (measurable) – includes a quality or quantity measure. Define what evidence will prove you’re making progress and re-evaluate when necessary.

__A__ (attainable) – can be challenging but must be achievable. Make sure you can reasonably accomplish your goal within a certain timeframe.

__R__ (relevant) – make sense and are meaningful to you. Your goals should align with your values and long-term aims.

__T__ (time-bound) – with a clear end date or timescale – they may be short or longer term. Set a realistic, ambitious end-date for task prioritisation and motivation.

Forecasting

# Forecasting

If everything in the world were predictable in advance, there would be no uncertainty.

At the same time, there would be no risk in human actions.

![](img/Lecture%204%20-%20Planning26.jpg)

# Key terms to know

* Forecasting
  * A method of obtaining information about future events, changes in objects, or potential situations.
  * It is always related to the future - near, distant, or very distant.
  * The most important characteristic of forecasting is reliability, which is determined by the time horizon, the forecasting methods used, and the information used.
* __Uncertainty__
  * The lack or insufficiency of information about something.
  * The less information available, the greater the uncertainty, and the more difficult it is to make decisions.
* Risk
  * Possible deviations of actual results from expected ones.
  * It is often associated with the probability of an unwanted, worthless, or harmful outcome, error, or loss.

  * Expert panels: A group of experts provides their opinions on a specific topic or product.
  * Historical analogy: Past events are used to predict future events.

# Role of assumptions in planning

Due to the uncertainty of the future, it is necessary to use  __assumptions__  or  __predetermined conditions __ when preparing a plan.

_Example:_

Goal: to double the company's profit.

Alternatives:

Increase the current product sales volume. Assumption: the organization has the ability to capture a larger market share with the existing product.

Create and sell a completely new product. Assumption: There is sufficient market share for a new product.

Types of planning

# Strategical planning

* __Strategy__
  * It is a set of decisions that identify the most important future goals, actions, and measures to achieve those goals.
* __Strategic planning__
  * It is a set of actions aimed at developing a program (plan) for the implementation of the strategy.
  * The purpose of strategic planning is to ensure the implementation of  __innovations and changes __ in the organization.
  * In the context of strategic planning, the strategy is treated as a comprehensive plan for achieving the organization's mission and goals.

# Main characteristics of strategic planning

A wide range of objects and activities

Relatively long period of time (2-5 years)

Extending the time horizon reduces the detail of the strategic plan

It requires aggregation, creativity, foresight and ingenuity.

Levels of strategic planning: 1) organizational, 2) operational (i.e. independent units), 3) functional (e.g. finance, marketing, production, etc.)

# Components of strategic planning

# Tactical planning

Tactical planning focuses on specific actions, initiatives, and programs that will achieve the overall strategic goals.

It is typically for a period of one to three years.

It is carried out by middle management who have the responsibility for implementing the strategies and tactics set by the senior management.

Tactical plans are specific and measurable, and include details such as budgets, timelines, and resources required.

It involves making decisions on how to allocate resources, assign tasks, and monitor progress towards goals.

The outcome of tactical planning is a set of action plans that guide day-to-day activities to achieve strategic objectives.

# Operational planning

Operational planning is a detailed planning process that focuses on the day-to-day activities.

The primary goal of operational planning is to ensure that the organization's resources are used efficiently and effectively to achieve its goals.

It includes setting measurable targets, allocating resources, and developing detailed action plans that outline the steps required to achieve each objective.

Operational planning is typically done on a shorter-term basis than strategic or tactical planning, often covering a period of one year or less.

Plans

# Definition of a plan

* Plan
  * It is the outcome of planning activities.
  * A pre-determined course of action that indicates the direction of activity for members of the organization.
  * Expected outcome, the direction of action to be implemented, stages to be passed, tasks to be performed.
  * The sum of information about planned measures and actions, interconnected by object and time characteristics.

# Classification of plans

* Time frame:
  * Short-term plan: A plan that covers a period of up to one year, such as a monthly sales plan or a daily production plan.
  * Long-term plan: A plan that covers a period of more than one year, such as a five-year strategic plan or a ten-year capital investment plan.
* Frequency of use:
  * Standing plan: A plan that is used repeatedly, such as a standard operating procedure or a quality control checklist.
  * Single-use plan: A plan that is developed for a specific, one-time purpose, such as a project plan for a new product launch or a crisis management plan.
* Formality:
  * Informal plan: A plan that is not written down and may not be well-defined, such as a verbal agreement between colleagues or a mental checklist of tasks.
  * Formal plan: A plan that is clearly defined and documented, such as a written policy or a detailed project plan.
* Information presentation forms:
  * Verbal plan: A plan that is presented through spoken communication, such as a verbal agreement or a meeting agenda.
  * Written plan: A plan that is presented through written communication, such as a business plan or a project proposal.
  * Visual plan: A plan that is presented through visual aids, such as a flowchart or a Gantt chart.

# What is the difference between a plan and a schedule?

# Hierarchy of plans

Plans are classified into a hierarchy based on their level of detail, scope, and time frame

Each level of planning is interconnected and the success of the higher levels is dependent on the successful implementation of the lower levels

The hierarchy of plans provides a framework for aligning the goals and objectives of an organization with the resources and actions required to achieve them

# Creation of tactical and operational plans

* _Typical stages of the plan development process_
  * Collection of information
  * Analysis
  * Optimization
  * Application
* _Typical information used_
  * What, how much, where needs to be done
  * Who has to perform
  * When to perform
  * What resources, how much and when are needed
  * What should be the result
* _Methods used_
  * Compilation of tables
  * Text description
  * Gantt chart
  * Critical path analysis

# What is a good plan?

Planning is a priority management function that involves identifying goals, objectives, and tasks, as well as forecasting future events to develop a roadmap for achieving those goals.

To be effective, planning should be characterized by clarity, specificity, and flexibility. Properly formulated goals and objectives, and assumptions play a significant role in creating a good plan.

Various things can be planned, including production, finance, marketing, personnel, and so on. Both quantitative and qualitative forecasting methods can be used to forecast future events and plan accordingly.

There are three types of planning: strategic, tactical, and operational. Each type focuses on a different time horizon and requires different methods to be developed. The hierarchy of plans helps to ensure that all plans are aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.
