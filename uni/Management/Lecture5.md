# What is organizing?

* Organizing
  * Organizing can be thought of as assigning the tasks developed under the planning function to various individuals or groups within the organization.
  * Organizing creates a mechanism to put plans into action.
  * Organizing includes determining tasks and groupings of work.
  * Organizing should not be rigid, but adaptable and flexible to meet challenges as circumstances change.

  * Organizing is a management function that involves the systematic arrangement of people, resources, and tasks to achieve the goals of an organization.

# What is specialization?

* Specialization or division of labor
  * the process of breaking down work into smaller, more specialized tasks that can be performed by individuals or groups with specific skills or experience.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :-: | :-: |
| Increased efficiency<br />Better quality<br />Lower costs<br />Increased job satisfaction, if skills can be utilized | Boredom and dissatisfaction, if the job is too specialized and routine<br />Limited skills development<br />Coordination challenges |

# Vertical specialization

* Vertical specialization
  * Type of specialization in which different specialized organizations or individuals perform different stages of the supply chain or production process
  * Each organization or individual specializes in a certain stage of the process and relies on other specialized organizations or individuals to perform other stages
  * __Example__ : production of a smartphone

# Horizontal specialization

* Horizontal specialization
  * Type of specialization where different specialized individuals or groups perform different tasks or activities at only one stage of production or service delivery.
  * Example: Food preparation in a restaurant.

# What is coordination?

* Coordination
  * The direction of work processes based on division of labor to achieve organizational goals.
  * It refers to the process of integrating the activities of different individuals, groups or departments within an organization.
  * Through coordination, specialized organizational elements are united into a cohesive entity working towards common goals.

_Coordination is the essence of management, as it helps to deal with the division of labor by ensuring that the efforts of individuals and groups are aligned and integrated toward common goals. _  _Harold Koontz and Cyril O'Donnell_

# What is departmentalization?

* Departmentalization
  * The grouping of tasks to coordinate collective activities and responsibilities.
* Strict ("narrow") division
  * Each department has a narrow scope of responsibility and is less autonomous.
  * Departments are highly dependent on each other, and coordination and communication between units are strictly controlled.
* Loose ("wide") division
  * Departments have more autonomy to make decisions and take action.
  * Departments are less dependent on each other, and coordination and communication between units are not as strictly controlled.

# Forms of departmentalization

* Functional departmentalization
  * For example, an organization may have separate marketing, finance, human resources, and production departments based on their functions.
* Product departmentalization
  * For example, an organization that produces multiple product lines may have separate departments for each product line.
* Customer departmentalization
  * For example, an organization may have separate departments for retail customers, business customers, and government clients.
* Geographic departmentalization
  * For example, an organization that operates in multiple regions or countries may have separate departments for each region or country.
* Process departmentalization
  * For example, an organization may have separate departments for order processing, production, and shipping.

# Chain of command

* Chain of command
  * This refers to the formal line of authority and communication in an organization and establishes who reports to whom and how decisions are made.
  * It runs from the top (e.g. CEO) to the bottom of the organizational structure.
  * Depending on the size of the organization, the length of the chain of command can vary (either "long" or "short").
* Functions:
  * Clarifies roles and responsibilities
  * Facilitates communication
  * Increases decision-making efficiency
  * Improves accountability

# Delegation, responsibility, power, authority

* Delegation
  * Is the process of assigning tasks, duties, and authority to another person within the organization.
  * Managers delegate tasks to their subordinates, transferring part of their workload and responsibility to others while empowering them to make decisions and take actions on behalf of the organization.
* Responsibility
  * refers to the obligation to perform a task.
* Authority
  * refers to the formal right or permission to make decisions and take action within the organization.
* Power
  * refers to the ability to influence or control the behavior of others and can take various forms, such as formal and informal power.

# Levels of management

![](img/Lecture%205%20-%20Organizing0.png)

# How many employees can a manager efficiently and effectively supervise?

# What is span of control?

* Span of control
  * The span of control is the number of subordinates that can be effectively managed.
  * The larger the number of relationships between subordinates and the manager, the wider the span of control.
  * A narrow span of control is usually associated with a higher level of supervision, control, and coordination.
  * A wide span of control is usually associated with a higher level of autonomy, independence, and empowerment.

# What is the difference between centralization and decentralization?

* _Who makes decisions in an organization?_
* Centralization
  * The concentration of decision-making power at the highest level of management.
  * If decision-making power is concentrated in one point or one person, then the organizational structure is centralized.
* Decentralization
  * The transfer of decision-making to lower levels of management.
  * When decision-making power is distributed among departments, divisions, or teams, the organizational structure is decentralized.

# What is formalization?

* Formalization
  * is an organizational principle that indicates the extent to which an organization's policies, procedures, rules, and job descriptions are standardized and documented.
  * The level of formalization can range from low, where few rules and procedures are documented, to high, where many rules and procedures are standardized and documented.
* Formal organizational structure
  * refers to the official, document-based structure of an organization, including its power hierarchy, communication lines, and job responsibilities.
  * The formal structure is typically depicted in an organizational chart that outlines the roles of different positions within the organization and their reporting relationships.
* Informal organizational structure
  * refers to the network of relationships, communication channels, and informal practices that exist within an organization, often outside of the official hierarchy and formal structure.

# What determines the choice of organizational principles?

* Nature of the organization
  * For example, a large, complex organization may require a more formal structure with a narrow span of control, while a smaller, more flexible organization may be better suited to a decentralized structure with a wider span of control.
* Goals and objectives
  * For example, an organization that values innovation and creativity may prioritize horizontal specialization and decentralization to encourage collaboration and flexibility, while an organization that values consistency and control may prioritize vertical specialization and centralization to maintain standardization and compliance.
* External environment
  * For example, an organization operating in a highly regulated industry may prioritize formalization and centralization to ensure adherence to rules, while an organization operating in a dynamic, rapidly changing industry may prioritize flexibility and decentralization to adapt to changing circumstances.
* Priorities and values
  * For example, a leader who values employee empowerment and autonomy may prioritize decentralization, while a leader who values control and consistency may prioritize centralization.

# Mechanistic and organic organization

* Mechanistic organization
  * A bureaucratic organization that represents a traditional "top-down" approach. The structure is characterized by high specialization, formalization, and centralization, a narrow management scope, strict departmentalization, and a clear chain of command.
  * There are many formal rules and procedures, centralized decision-making, narrowly defined responsibilities, and a strict hierarchical structure.
* Organic organization
  * An organization that promotes collaboration and a more flexible approach. The structure is characterized by low specialization, informality, decentralization, a loose division of units, and a chain of command, whether long or short, which can sometimes be difficult to interpret.
  * There is moderate use of formal rules and procedures, decentralization and employee involvement in decision-making, widely defined responsibilities for tasks, structural flexibility, and a small number of hierarchical levels.

Organizational structure

# What is organizational structure?

* Structure
  * The arrangement of parts or elements and the relationships between them as a whole.
* Organization
  * A group of individuals who work together towards a common goal.
* Organizational management structure
  * Defines and regulates the relationships between different positions and roles within an organization, giving the organization a certain form. It is necessary to coordinate the activities of the organization, delegate authority, and ensure control over its operations.

# What is the purpose of organizational structure?

![](img/Lecture%205%20-%20Organizing4.png)

As the number of elements increases, the number of connections between them increases progressively.

Thus, the complexity of a system increases.

To manage complexity, structure must be introduced.

# What is organizational hierarchy?

* Hierarchy
  * is the arrangement of elements into levels or ranks based on their importance, depicted as "above," "below," or "at the same level" with each other.
* Organizational hierarchy
  * refers to the importance of positions held by members of an organization based on their level of authority. It establishes a system of authority and control within the organization through the creation of a certain number of management levels. (See slide "Chain of Command," "Management Levels.")
* A certain degree of hierarchy exists in every organizational structure!

# Functional structure

![](img/Lecture%205%20-%20Organizing8.png)

  * Employees are grouped according to similar functions or areas of competence, such as finance, marketing, operations, and so on.
  * In a functional structure, each functional area is typically led by a manager or director who oversees the work of employees in that area.

# Divisional structure

The organization is divided into semi-autonomous units based on factors such as geography, product lines, processes, or customer groups.

Each unit has its own functional areas such as marketing, finance, and operations, and operates as a fairly independent unit within the larger organization.

# Matrix structure

![](img/Lecture%205%20-%20Organizing13.png)

  * Matrix structure combines the features of functional and divisional structures.
  * In a matrix structure, each employee usually has two bosses: a functional manager who supervises their work in a specific functional area, and a project manager who supervises their work on a specific project or product.

# Flat structure

Hierarchical structure

Less levels of hierarchy

Decentralized decision-making

Teams can be organized by projects, customers or products

Team leaders have decision-making authority

Promotes flexibility, adaptability, and employee empowerment

Many levels of hierarchy

Centralized decision-making

Clear chain of command

Each level has its duties and decision-making authority

Promotes stability, consistency, and standardization

# Key takeaway

* An organization can have characteristics of multiple types of structures at the same time.
  * For example, an organization may have a functional structure in each department of the company, and also use a matrix structure to manage specific projects.
* Organizational structure is constantly changing due to various external and internal factors.
  * For example, if a technology company acquires another company with a different organizational structure, it may need to restructure its organization to effectively integrate the new company.
* If an organization grows, its management structure must change.
  * For example, a small startup may begin with a flat structure that allows for flexible and quick decision-making, but as the company grows and becomes more complex, it may transition to a more hierarchical structure to promote stability and consistency.
