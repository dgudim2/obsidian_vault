# The essence of the controlling function

![](img/Lecture%206%20-%20Control%20and%20Accounting2.jpg)

* Controlling
  * Management function that involves monitoring activities to ensure they are carried out as planned and correcting any significant deviations
  * Only through it that one can know whether the organization's goals are achieved and, if not, why
  * Integral, constantly performed, regardless of whether the organization's activities are successful or not
  * In implementing control, two main questions are raised: what needs to be controlled and how to control it

# 2 controlling principles: Continuous improvement and management by exception

|  | Continuous improvement  | Management by exception  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Definition | Continuous improvement is a method of ongoing business process analysis, evaluation, and enhancement, aiming to increase efficiency. | The management principle where the primary focus is on identifying and addressing deviations from expected performance rather than on every detail of the process.  |
| Methods | It involves the use of various improvement methods, including Lean, Six Sigma, and Kaizen, to identify areas of improvement and systematically eliminate waste and inefficiency.  | This approach involves setting specific performance standards or criteria, evaluating performance against those standards, and taking corrective actions if any deviations are found. |
| Focus | This approach includes a focus on continuous learning and growth, as well as collaboration between employees and management to pinpoint areas for improvement and develop solutions. | According to this principle, managers do not need to be involved in making every decision or process detail. Instead, they can concentrate their attention on areas where business results do not meet expectations and take actions to address these problems.  |
| Goals | The goal is to achieve long-term sustainable improvements in an organization's or process's performance, rather than just short-term fixes. | The principle aims to determine the priorities of managers' time and resources and use them as efficiently as possible. It is based on the idea that most processes will operate within a normal range of variability, and deviations from this range are exceptions rather than the rule. |

# What does the controlling process consist of?

    * In the control process model, it is assumed that performance standards already exist.
    * This can be achieved if they are created as specific goals during the planning process.

# “You can't control what you can't measure or evaluate”

# How do managers measure or evaluate performance?

* To determine the actual outcome or evaluate it, a manager first needs to obtain information about it.
* There are four common sources of information that are often used:
  * Personal observation ("Management by walking around")
  * Statistical reports
  * Verbal reports (annual reviews, morning stand-up meetings, etc.)
  * Written reports (employee surveys, regular emails about the current situation, etc.)

# Management by walking around – MBWA

![](img/Lecture%206%20-%20Control%20and%20Accounting4.png)

* Management by walking around (MBWA)
  * When the manager is in the work area, they communicate with employees and exchange information about what is happening

# What are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?

KPIs are specific metrics used to evaluate results against established goals or objectives.

KPIs can be both quantitative and qualitative.

Examples of KPIs may include sales revenue, customer satisfaction, production efficiency, financial results, and so on.

KPIs should be carefully selected based on the goals and objectives of the organization or process, and should be specific, measurable, and significant.

The use of KPIs can help organizations establish clear performance expectations, identify areas for improvement, monitor progress, better coordinate different functions and departments, and cultivate a culture of continuous improvement.

# How is a comparison performed?

![](img/Lecture%206%20-%20Control%20and%20Accounting5.png)

* Range of variation
  * Acceptable range of dispersion between actual performance and standard parameters
  * It is necessary to pay attention to deviations beyond the boundaries of this range.

# What control actions can be taken?

Managers can choose one of three possible directions for action:

do nothing

take corrective action

review standards (goals)

# What could be corrective actions?

* Immediate corrective actions
  * are those that immediately address the problems so that the results are once again acceptable. They eliminate symptoms but not the root cause.
* Fundamental corrective actions
  * are corrective actions in which, before correcting the deviation source, a review is made of how and why the results deviated.

# Types of control

* Feedforward control
  * Control that takes place before performing work activities
* Concurrent control
  * Control that is performed while work activities are being carried out
* Feedback control
  * Control that is performed after work activities are completed.

Accounting function

# The essence of the accounting function

* Accounting
  * The process of identifying, measuring, and presenting information about an organization's activities, enabling users of the information to make informed decisions.
* Accounting Elements
  * Documentation - recording of business operations
  * Inventory - physical verification of material and intangible assets against accounting data or preparation of a list of such assets
  * Ledgers - a list of an organization's financial accounts, usually maintained by an accountant, that can be used to record transactions in the organization's general journal.
  * Double-entry bookkeeping - a method of recording business transactions and events in which the value of each transaction or event is entered in the debit column of one or more accounts and an equal value is entered in the credit column of one or more other accounts.
  * Valuation - the process of measuring the value of certain accounting tools.
  * Cost accounting - determining the costs associated with each unit of production.
  * Balance sheet - an accounting document used to show an organization's assets and liabilities.
  * Reporting - the periodic preparation of financial data about the financial position, operating results, cash flows, and their explanation in a specified format.

# Types of accounting

* According to the accounting results, the following types of information users are distinguished:
  * Bookeeping – external and internal users
    * Financial
    * Tax
  * Statistical – statistical institutions
  * Operational – organization employees
* _Accounting policy_
  * A combination of certain accounting principles, methods, and rules
  * Each organization establishes its own policy taking into account various internal and environmental factors, including legal requirements
  * Components are distinguished: methodological, technical, organizational

# Bookkeeping

* Bookkeeping
  * A system for recording, grouping, and summarizing economic transactions and events expressed in monetary terms, used to obtain information for making economic decisions and/or preparing financial statements.
  * Its distinctive feature is strict regulation.

# The bookkeeping cycle

# Statistical accounting

* Statistical accounting
  * System for registering, collecting, and managing data about economic, social, and public objects and phenomena.
  * Organizations are elements of this system and the main source of statistical data.

# Operational accounting

* Operational accounting (management accounting)
  * Collection, systematization, evaluation, and provision of information necessary for managing an economic entity
  * Its purpose is to create an objective information base reflecting the state of managed objects and to ensure focused dissemination of this information
  * The information collected during this process is necessary for making management decisions and is used from operational control to strategic management
  * It is not publicly regulated by state laws.

Budget, its preparation and control

# What role does budgeting play in your personal financial management strategy?

# What is a budget?

* Budget is:
  * A financial plan
  * A tool for controlling operations
  * An instrument for evaluating performance
  * A means of informing stakeholders about goals and objectives

![](img/Lecture%206%20-%20Control%20and%20Accounting8.jpg)

# Common budgeting methods

* Incremental budgeting
  * Using the previous year's budget as a starting point, a percentage is added or subtracted to determine the current budget.
* Activity-based budgeting
  * Created by considering how much an organization will need to spend on activities necessary to achieve its goals.
* Value-based budgeting
  * Every expense would yield a certain return on investment or generate tangible value.
* Zero-based budgeting
  * Starting from scratch. Each expenditure must be justified based on current needs, rather than relying on past budgets.

# What is budget control?

* Budget control
  * It is the process of monitoring how an organization's activities align with its budget (preventing overspending, collecting expected revenues).
  * It can be applied at various levels of the organization.
  * It allows tracking of expenses and operations over a reporting period to avoid overspending.
  * It helps cope with constant organizational changes.

The Balanced Scorecard

# The balanced scorecard

* Balanced Scorecard
  * is a tool for monitoring and measuring the ongoing performance of a company, which takes into account not only the financial perspective, but also customers, internal processes, employees, and more.
* Benefits include:
  * Clearly identifying and communicating strategic goals and objectives of the organization
  * Helping to translate strategy implementation into day-to-day activities

![](img/Lecture%206%20-%20Control%20and%20Accounting9.png)

Control is a fundamental management function that involves monitoring an organization's performance results to ensure the achievement of its goals. Key performance indicators, or KPIs, are important tools for evaluating and measuring an organization's performance, used to compare actual results with planned targets.

Accounting involves the process of measuring, recording, and communicating information about an organization's business activities.

Budget control is the process of monitoring and managing an organization's performance results in comparison with the budget. It is an essential tool for managing an organization's finances and making informed decisions about future investments and expenses.

The Balanced Scorecard system is a strategic planning and management tool that goes beyond the limits of the financial perspective and takes into account various aspects of an organization's activities, including customers, internal processes, employees, and others.
