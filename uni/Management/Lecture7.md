![](img/Lecture%207%20-%20Directing14.jpg)

# Management ethics

Since the beginning of the 2000s\, numerous large organizations have failed or have been on the brink of failure due to the unethical and/or immoral behavior of their managers\.

The moral component has emerged as a key aspect of contemporary leadership theories\.

If managers at the top of an organization behave ethically\, it has a cascading effect on the entire organization\.

False product claims

Hidden conditions in user contracts

Unethical accounting/tax evasion

Poor working conditions

Sexual harassment

Unfair competition/smear campaigns

Illegal misappropriation of trade secrets

Bribery

Sale of client data

and others\.

Directing is one of the four main functions of management\, which involves guiding and supervising employees to achieve organizational goals\.

Directing encompasses the following activities: communication\, leadership\, motivation\, delegation\, conflict resolution\, and employee development\.

According to H\. Mintzberg's role theory\, managers have ten distinct roles that can be classified into three categories: interpersonal\, informational\, and decisional\.

Not every manager is a good leader\, and not every leader is a good manager\.

Professional ethics are important for managers to maintain trust\, respect\, and integrity within their organizations\, and to avoid negative consequences such as legal or financial penalties\, loss of reputation\, or employee dissatisfaction\.
