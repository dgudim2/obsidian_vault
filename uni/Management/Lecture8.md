What is a motivational system?

# What is motivation?

* Motivation
  * The strength of a person's inner desire to engage in an activity
  * A combination of internal and external forces that drive a person to behave in a certain way
  * A process that regulates an individual's actions and relationships with the environment
  * A process that encourages a person to behave in a way that achieves important goals or satisfies their needs
  * An important subject of study in both psychology and management\, seeking to answer the question "Why does a person do x action?"
  * Motivation is not a constant\, static state\.

# Model of motivation

Internal control system of a person

Action \(behaviour\)

External control system

Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

# What is motivation from a management perspective?

* Employee motivation
  * A part of directing function that involves influencing employee behavior to achieve organizational goals
  * Encouraging people to act in a way that helps them and the organization achieve their objectives and satisfy everyone's needs
  * The process of promoting purposeful action related to meeting employees' needs
  * A combination of related goals\, activation methods\, and tools used to increase interest and motivation\.

  * __Motivating__  is a part of the directing function that involves the process of engaging\, encouraging efforts and actions of employees to achieve organizational goals\.

Theories of motivation

# Theory (what?), method (how?), tool (with what?)

* __Theory__
  * It is a set of interconnected concepts\, ideas\, definitions\, and hypotheses that reflect a systematic view of phenomena and aim to explain and predict the relationships between variables\.
  * Theory combines individual empirical data into a clear conceptual system whose essence is to give meaning to everything that is known about the phenomena under investigation\.
* __Method__
  * A way or means of doing something\.
* __Tool__
  * It can take many forms \(tool\, template\, standard\, format\, skill\, ability\, formula\, visualization\, etc\.\) and is applied in the chosen method used\.

| The nature and structure of needs | The fulfillment of needs and motives |

# Various motivation theories

_Maslow‘s hierarchy of needs_

_McGregor‘s Theory X and Theory Y_

_Herzberg‘s Motivation\-Hygiene Theory_

_Alderfer‘s ERG Theory_

_McClelland’s Theory of Needs_

_Locke‘s Goal Setting Theory_

_Skinner‘s Reinforcement Theory_

_Adam‘s Equity Theory of Motivation_

_Vroom‘s Expectancy Theory of Motivation_

_Theory Z_

And others

# Maslow‘s hierarchy of needs

Satisfying the need for personal growth\, seeking the meaning of life\, revealing all of one's talents and abilities

The need for self\-realization

Efforts to gain a good reputation\, to be valued\, respected\, and recognized by others

The needs for self\-respect and respect

Relationships with other people\, attachment to them\, love\, and belonging to various groups and collectives

The needs for love and emotional relationships \(social\)

Clarity\, order\, absence of emotional\, physical\, and psychological threats\, fear\, poverty\, etc\.

The need for safety

Basic survival needs such as air\, water\, food\, sleep\, warmth\-cold\, etc\.

Physiological needs

# X theory, Y theory, and Z theory

| Assumptions | X theory | Y theory | Z theory |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Personality characteristics | Most people are passive and irrational, | Higher level needs for respect and self-actualization are ongoing needs that are never fully satisfied for most people. | Employees are loyal to their employer who genuinely cares about their personal development, health, and family. |
| Work | For most people, work is unpleasant by nature, so they will try to avoid work whenever possible. | Work can be as natural as play if the conditions are favorable. | Employees have faith in and take pride in their work, striving to do their best. |
| Responsibility | Most people are not ambitious, have little desire for responsibility, and want to be directed. | Employees seek responsibility under the right conditions. | Employees are encouraged to take collective responsibility and are expected to participate in making organizational decisions. |
| Changes, innovations | Most people have little creativity in solving organizational problems. Most people resist change. | Employees are creative and innovative by nature. They are eager for change. | Individual contributions are valued, but must always be considered in the context of the entire organization/team. |
| Control | Most people are egocentric. Therefore, they must be carefully controlled and often coerced to achieve organizational goals. | Employees prefer limited control and direction. They control and direct themselves. | Employees have the right to perform tasks as they see fit, but management is expected to establish formal means of assessing work quality and results. |
| Motivational tools | Motivation arises only at the physiological and safety levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Therefore, people are mostly motivated by monetary means. | People will be committed to achieving quality and productivity goals if they are given rewards that meet higher needs, such as self-actualization. | Employees need guaranteed employment and will accept slower evaluations. |

Motivational system

# Motivation system and its development aspects

* Motivation system
  * Includes a range of motivation methods\, tools and processes that are integrated as a whole to encourage productive work\.
  * The combination of financial and non\-financial motivation measures\, which are aligned with the organization's culture\, structure and management style\, encourages employees to achieve the organization's goals\.
* Aspects of creating a motivation system
  * If the motivation system is developed correctly\, the organization has a real chance to operate successfully and stay afloat\.
  * Motivating factors stimulate different people differently\, so each manager faces the challenge of "awakening" a person's responsibility\, autonomy and adequate feedback for the organization\.
  * Since using the same motivation methods for a long time becomes ineffective\, developing a motivation system is an ongoing process of improvement\.
  * Each organization's motivation system is unique\.

Motivation plays a very important role in the function of directing and involves the process of engaging\, encouraging\, and supporting employees to achieve organizational goals\.

Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are essential components of employee motivation\. Intrinsic motivation promotes personal satisfaction and long\-term employee engagement\, while extrinsic motivation helps achieve short\-term goals through external rewards or punishments\.

The wide variety of motivation theories highlights the complexity of human motivation and emphasizes that managers must adopt a flexible approach\, understand and consider individual differences\, organizational context\, and cultural factors to effectively apply motivational strategies that engage and inspire employees to achieve the best results\.

A well\-designed motivational system is necessary to increase employee engagement and satisfaction\. It must combine various motivational methods and tools\, taking into account individual employee needs\. It is crucial that the motivational system is regularly reviewed and updated\.
