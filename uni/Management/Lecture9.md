Employee performance evaluation methods

# Employee performance evaluation methods

* There are many different ones:
  * Graphic rating scales
  * Paired comparison method
  * Forced distribution method
  * Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale \(BARS\)
  * Management by Objective \(MBO\) or Joint Target Setting\, Key Result Areas \(KRAs\)
  * Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\)
  * 360\-degree feedback
  * Cost Accounting Method
  * Assessment centers
  * Annual performance review meeting

# Graphic rating scales

# Paired comparison method

![](img/Lecture%209%20-%20Performance%20Evaluation2.jpg)

# Forced distribution method

* This method involves pre\-determining a percentage of employees who are categorized based on their work results\.
* The manager can divide employees as follows:
  * 15% work very well
  * 20% work well and moderately
  * 30% work moderately
  * 20% work moderately and poorly
  * 15% work very poorly

# Cost Accounting Method

* This method evaluates an employee's performance based on the employee's contribution in monetary terms\. Here\, the evaluator assesses the employee based on the costs of retaining them and the benefits the organization derives from their contribution\.
* When using this method\, the following factors are taken into account:
  * Eployee training costs
  * Quality of services provided or products produced
  * Accidents\, defects\, errors\, breakdowns\, waste\, etc\.
  * Time spent evaluating the employee

# Assessment centers

This method is mainly used to assess the potential of top\-level managers

Employees are taken to a location far from work\, subjected to a series of tests and exercises\, such as being asked to participate in a variety of activities; simulations\, group exercises and role\-plays\, etc\.

Each of these tests assesses the employee's behavior and provides feedback based on strengths and weaknesses

# Annual performance review meeting

* Annual meeting
  * it is a manager's conversation with a subordinate that takes place once a year
  * it may involve more senior managers than the line manager\.
* Objectives of the annual meeting
  * set individual performance goals for employees related to the goals of the the department
  * provide employees with feedback on their work and increase employee motivation to achieve agreed goals and adjust their work behavior
  * to discuss directions and measures of employee education and performance improvement
  * find out the suggestions of employees regarding the increase of operational efficiency and expectations regarding the collegues\, managers\, motivation\, career\, etc\. needs

# Challenges in evaluation

* Halo effect
  * Cognitive bias\, when there is a tendency to value one positive characteristic of a person while misvaluing other characteristics
* Permissiveness
  * Honest assessments are avoided to avoid conflicts
* Narrow focus on recent events
* "Like me" \(similarity\)
  * Favoring those with similar values or interests

Work remuneration \(compensation\) system

# Reward for work
