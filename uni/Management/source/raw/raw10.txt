Schizoid culture
In this culture, the behavior of top-level managers is influenced by distance and distrust, with a noticeable indifference - neither making friends nor getting angry. There is a power vacuum at lower levels of management, so there is a struggle for position, coalitions are formed, and informal groups emerge.
Opportunistic culture
In such a culture, there is usually a certain closedness and a tendency to offend. People&apos;s behavior in such companies is usually influenced by the integration of values ​​based on exclusivity and the denial of individual culture. In such a company, procedure is more important than the essence of the matter.
Commitment culture
It is an open culture in terms of both business and social aspects, willing to implant other differentiated cultures, and exchange ideas. However, in such a culture, there is a risk of a value conflict, and a lot of time is spent on coordinating interests. Therefore, such a culture can be a reason for high costs.

Paranoid culture
Organizations that exhibit a paranoid culture are characterized by attributes of distrust and fear. In such organizations, leaders react vehemently to any interference. They constantly look for other people&apos;s mistakes and those who want to harm them.
Coercion-based culture
Organizations with a coercion-based culture emphasize order, and relationships among people are characterized by a focus on obedience. In such organizations, unexpected events must be eliminated, everything is considered and regulated, and emotions are unnecessary.
Depressive culture
It is characterized by fear and mistrust, as well as pessimistic forecasts. It is clear that in such organizations, fate is believed in, and support is expected from elsewhere. It is natural that in such circumstances, the life of the organization revolves around a routine environment, where routine determines people&apos;s behavior.

What is organizational climate?
Organizational climate
Refers to how an employee experiences and perceives the work environment and culture in which they work.
Organizational culture is a broader concept, while climate is more narrowly defined in terms of employees&apos; overall perceptions of an organization&apos;s policies, practices, procedures, and compensation systems.
Strong and weak organizational culture
Culture is 
strong
 when organizational members act because their values are aligned with the organization&apos;s values.
People act because they believe what they do is what should be done.
The danger of groupthink (excessive trust in a central charismatic leader, over-reliance on organizational values): people cannot resist groupthink, and innovative ideas are diminished.
Culture is 
weak
 when these values tend to deviate from the organization&apos;s values.
Control is used, which manifests in numerous bureaucratic procedures.
Organizations that seek innovation require people who are willing to think critically and creatively about the current situation – regardless of whether the organization is dominated by groupthink or bureaucracy.
What makes up organizational culture?
Symbols
Physical – slogans, logos, visual identity, clothing choices
Behavior – rituals, customs, rewards and punishments
Verbal – anecdotes, stories, metaphors, and all other communication shared by members of the organization
Core values
The common principles and standards of the organization&apos;s people
These shared values are essential for defining the organization
Vision, mission, and value statements must be linked to the organization&apos;s actions
Perceptions, assumptions
The source of values is what is &quot;known&quot; but not discussed, not written down, easily identifiable

Organizational culture refers to shared values, beliefs, and practices that shape people&apos;s behavior in an organization, while organizational climate refers to the prevailing atmosphere or tone that characterizes the work environment of an organization.
Organizational culture is relatively stable and long-lasting, while organizational climate is more dynamic and can change over time.
The elements of organizational culture include three layers consisting of artifacts and symbols, supported by values and underlying assumptions. While the artifacts and symbols layer is quite visible, and the underlying assumptions layer is completely invisible, the elements of all three layers are interrelated and influence each other.
Creativity is a vital aspect of organizational culture that can drive innovation, growth, and competitive advantage for organizations.

Questions
Knowledge sharing is a process of exchanging information, skills, and expertise among individuals or groups within an organization. It is an essential aspect of creating a culture of innovation, growth, and collaboration.
Sharing knowledge can take many forms, including formal training sessions, workshops, team meetings, mentoring programs, and informal discussions. The aim of knowledge sharing is to create an environment where employees are encouraged to share their knowledge, experience, and insights with others.
One of the main benefits of knowledge sharing is that it helps to improve the overall knowledge and expertise within an organization. When employees share their knowledge and experience, they contribute to the growth and development of the organization. This, in turn, leads to greater efficiency, productivity, and innovation.
Knowledge sharing also helps to build a culture of collaboration and teamwork. When employees share their knowledge, they are more likely to work together to achieve common goals. This approach fosters collaboration and helps to create a sense of belonging and shared responsibility among team members.
Another important benefit of knowledge sharing is that it promotes continuous learning and professional development. When employees are encouraged to share their knowledge and skills, they are more likely to seek out new learning opportunities and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field.
To promote knowledge sharing, organizations can provide formal training programs, establish mentoring relationships, create forums for open discussion and exchange of ideas, and recognize and reward employees who share their knowledge and expertise.
Organizational culture is a collection of shared values, unwritten rules, and beliefs that determine how people behave and interact with each other within an organization.
It plays a crucial role in shaping the identity of the organization and influencing the 
behavior
 of its members.
Encouraging self-reflection is an important aspect of personal and professional development. Self-reflection is the process of examining one&apos;s own thoughts, feelings, and actions to gain insight and improve performance. By encouraging self-reflection, individuals can gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and identify areas for improvement.
Self-reflection involves taking a step back from daily activities and examining one&apos;s thoughts, feelings, and actions. It requires individuals to ask themselves questions about their performance and 
behavior
 and to be open and honest with themselves. This process can help individuals to identify patterns of 
behavior
 that may be hindering their performance and to develop strategies for improvement.
Encouraging self-reflection can have several benefits for individuals and organizations. For individuals, self-reflection can lead to personal growth, increased self-awareness, and improved decision-making skills. It can also help individuals to identify their strengths and weaknesses and develop strategies for achieving their goals.
For organizations, encouraging self-reflection can lead to improved performance and productivity. When employees are encouraged to reflect on their work and 
behavior
, they are more likely to identify areas for improvement and take steps to address them. This can lead to greater efficiency and better outcomes for the organization.
To encourage self-reflection, organizations can provide opportunities for employees to reflect on their work, such as regular performance reviews or self-evaluation exercises. Organizations can also provide training and support to help employees develop their self-reflection skills and create a culture that values self-reflection and continuous improvement.
A strong organizational culture is characterized by members who act in a way that aligns with the values of the organization. When individuals act in accordance with the values of the organization, they are more likely to feel a sense of belonging and identity with the organization. This creates a shared sense of purpose and direction, leading to increased motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity. People tend to act because they believe that what they are doing is the right thing to do.
However, there is a danger of groupthink in organizations that rely too heavily on a charismatic central leader or have excessive belief in their organizational values. Groupthink occurs when individuals conform to the opinions or decisions of a group, even if they disagree with them. This can stifle innovation and creativity and lead to a lack of diversity of thought. When individuals cannot resist groupthink, innovative ideas may be reduced, and the organization may suffer.
In contrast, a weak organizational culture is characterized by values that diverge from the values of the organization. Control is often used, and this manifests itself in many bureaucratic procedures. In this type of culture, individuals may not feel a sense of alignment with the organization, leading to decreased motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.
Organizations striving for innovation need people who are prepared to think critically and creatively about the status quo, whether the organization is dominated by groupthink or bureaucracy. To achieve this, organizations should foster a culture that values diversity of thought, encourages open communication, and promotes a growth mindset. This type of culture will attract and retain employees who share the organization&apos;s values and are willing to think critically and creatively to drive innovation and growth.
Creativity is an essential characteristic of individuals who strive to generate new ideas and innovative solutions. It involves the ability to combine existing ideas and knowledge in new and original ways to solve problems and create value.
One of the key components of creativity is domain knowledge and skills. This refers to the individual&apos;s knowledge and understanding of their area of expertise, including work technologies, procedures, and a general understanding of the field of activity. This knowledge is typically acquired through formal education, work experience, and interaction with other professionals.
Another crucial aspect of creativity is creative thinking. This is the ability to approach problems in a flexible and imaginative way, by connecting existing ideas in new and unique ways. It is essential for individuals to be able to think creatively to develop innovative solutions to problems.
In addition to domain knowledge and creative thinking, motivation also plays a critical role in creativity. Motivation refers to the individual&apos;s desire or need to be creative, and it determines whether the individual will actually generate new ideas or not. This motivation can come from external sources such as organizational rewards and punishments, or internal sources such as drive, passion, or personal interest.
An inspirational office interior is a workplace environment designed to stimulate imagination, creativity, and productivity. It is an environment that inspires and motivates employees to work at their best by creating a visually appealing and comfortable workspace that fosters creativity and innovation.
To create an inspirational office interior, several elements must be considered, including lighting, 
color
, furniture, and layout. Natural light is one of the most essential elements of an inspirational office interior. It can positively affect mood, energy, and productivity. Large windows and skylights that allow plenty of natural light into the workspace are highly recommended.
Color
 also plays a crucial role in creating an inspirational office interior. It can affect mood and productivity, so it is essential to choose 
colors
 that promote a positive and creative work environment. Bright, vibrant 
colors
, such as green and blue, can help to stimulate creativity and concentration.
Furniture is another critical element of an inspirational office interior. Comfortable and ergonomic furniture can help employees feel more relaxed and focused, reducing stress and increasing productivity. A variety of seating options, such as chairs, stools, and bean bags, can also provide employees with flexibility and freedom of movement.
The layout of the workspace also plays a crucial role in creating an inspirational office interior. An open layout that allows for collaboration and communication between employees can help to foster creativity and innovation. Separate work areas, such as private offices or quiet zones, can also provide employees with the opportunity to focus and concentrate on their work.
The 
behavior
 style of an organization&apos;s members can also be used to classify its culture. Three types of organizational cultures based on 
behavior
 style are passive/defensive culture, constructive culture, and aggressive/defensive culture.
A passive/defensive culture 
is characterized by members who avoid taking risks and are reactive rather than proactive. Individuals in this type of culture may be resistant to change and may focus more on avoiding mistakes than achieving success. Communication tends to be indirect and ambiguous, and there may be a lack of trust and low levels of engagement.
In contrast, 
a constructive culture 
is characterized by members who are proactive, collaborative, and open to change. Individuals in this type of culture take responsibility for their actions and are willing to take risks to achieve success. Communication is clear and direct, and there is a high level of trust and engagement.
An aggressive/defensive culture 
is characterized by members who are competitive and defensive. Individuals in this type of culture may be focused on winning at all costs and may engage in 
behaviors
 such as blaming others, withholding information, or taking credit for others&apos; work. Communication tends to be confrontational and defensive, and there may be a low level of trust and engagement.
Each type of culture has its own strengths and weaknesses. Passive/defensive cultures may be stable and predictable, but may lack innovation and may struggle to adapt to change. Constructive cultures may be innovative and adaptable, but may require more resources and may be prone to conflict. Aggressive/defensive cultures may be successful in the short term, but may suffer from high levels of turnover and low morale.
Organizational culture can also be characterized based on psychological criteria. Here are five examples:
A paranoid culture 
is one characterized by fear and mistrust. In such an organization, leaders are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, and there is a general sense of suspicion and apprehension. Any disruption or change is met with violent reactions, and individuals are often afraid to speak up or take risks.
A culture based on coercion 
emphasizes order and structure. Human relations are characterized by a subordination orientation, and there is a focus on eliminating surprises and controlling every aspect of the organization. Emotions are viewed as unnecessary and discouraged, and there is little room for creativity or innovation.
In 
a depressive culture
, fear, mistrust, and pessimistic forecasts are pervasive. Such organizations may have a fatalistic outlook and believe that they are at the mercy of external forces. Routine and established procedures govern the organization, and individuals may feel stuck in a monotonous and unfulfilling environment.
Organizations that promote creativity and innovation are more likely to stay competitive and achieve long-term success. There are various ways in which organizations can encourage and support creative activity.
One effective method is to create an inclusive team environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives. This means that team members should be encouraged to express their thoughts and opinions freely and without fear of judgment or ridicule. This approach fosters collaboration and encourages creative thinking.
Another way to promote creative activity is to design an inspirational office interior that stimulates imagination and creativity. This can include features such as natural light, vibrant 
colors
, open spaces, and artwork that inspires creativity.
Organizations can also promote creative activity by giving employees freedom and flexibility to work in their own way. This could involve flexible working hours, remote work options, or providing the necessary tools and resources for employees to work creatively and efficiently.
Knowledge sharing is another effective method of promoting creativity. When employees are encouraged to share their knowledge and experience, they are more likely to generate new ideas and approaches that can benefit the organization as a whole.
Encouraging self-reflection is also an effective method of promoting creativity. By providing opportunities for employees to reflect on their work and share their insights with others, organizations can foster a culture of innovation and creativity.
Finally, it is essential for organizations to have a risk-tolerant culture that encourages experimentation and learning from failures. Organizations that are willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes are more likely to generate innovative ideas and approaches that can help them stay competitive and achieve long-term success.
The model of organizational culture by Cameron and Quinn identifies four different types of cultures: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market. Each type of culture is characterized by different values and 
behaviors
, which can influence the way individuals interact within the organization.
A 
clan cultur
e is characterized by a focus on collaboration, teamwork, and employee involvement. In this type of culture, individuals have a strong sense of belonging and loyalty to the organization. Communication is open and informal, and there is a focus on developing relationships and trust. Clan cultures are often seen in family-owned businesses, non-profit organizations, and small businesses.
An 
adhocracy culture 
is characterized by a focus on innovation, creativity, and risk-taking. In this type of culture, individuals are encouraged to take risks and experiment with new ideas. Communication is often informal and based on expertise rather than formal hierarchy. Adhocracy cultures are often seen in start-ups, technology companies, and creative industries.
A hierarchy culture 
is characterized by a focus on structure, stability, and control. In this type of culture, individuals are expected to adhere to strict rules and procedures, and decision-making is centralized. Communication is formal and based on the formal hierarchy of the organization. Hierarchy cultures are often seen in large, bureaucratic organizations such as government agencies and financial institutions.
A market culture 
is characterized by a focus on competition and achievement. In this type of culture, individuals are driven by performance and results, and decision-making is based on competition with other organizations. Communication is formal and focused on achieving goals and targets. Market cultures are often seen in sales-driven organizations and industries such as finance and consulting.
Each type of culture has its own strengths and weaknesses. Clan cultures can foster a sense of belonging and loyalty, but may struggle to adapt to change. Adhocracy cultures can be innovative and creative, but may lack stability and structure. Hierarchy cultures can provide stability and control, but may struggle to adapt to change or innovation. Market cultures can be competitive and results-driven, but may lack collaboration and teamwork.

Organizational climate refers to the long-term understanding of the employee&apos;s work environment and the culture of the business in which they work. It is a distinct and important aspect of organizational culture that has a significant impact on employee motivation, job satisfaction, and performance.
Organizational climate is often contrasted with organizational culture, which is a broader concept that encompasses most employees&apos; experiences at work. While culture is a more holistic and all-encompassing concept, climate is more narrowly defined in terms of employees&apos; shared perceptions of organizational policies, practices, procedures, and reward systems.
Organizational climate can be influenced by a variety of factors, including leadership style, communication, employee involvement, and the physical work environment. A positive organizational climate is characterized by a supportive and collaborative work environment, where employees feel valued, respected, and empowered. In contrast, a negative organizational climate is characterized by a lack of trust, poor communication, low morale, and high turnover rates.
Organizations can improve their climate by creating a culture that values and supports employee well-being, recognizes and rewards employees for their contributions, and provides opportunities for growth and development. This can be achieved through various initiatives such as employee engagement surveys, training and development programs, and employee recognition and reward systems.
 
Symbols are a vital aspect of organizational culture, and they can be categorized into physical, 
behavioral
, and verbal symbols. Physical symbols include things like logos, slogans, visual identity, and clothing choices. 
Behavioral
 symbols refer to rituals, customs, rewards, and punishments within an organization. Verbal symbols include stories, anecdotes, metaphors, and any other form of communication shared by members of an organization. These symbols help to convey the values, beliefs, and practices of the culture and create a sense of identity and belonging among the members.
Core values are the common principles and standards that guide the organization&apos;s people. They are necessary to define the organization and create a shared sense of purpose and direction. Vision, mission, and value statements should be linked to the actions of the organization, as this helps to ensure that the values are reflected in the organization&apos;s practices.
Perception and assumptions are another critical aspect of organizational culture. The source of values is often what is &quot;known&quot; but not explicitly discussed or spelled out. These unconscious thoughts, beliefs, perceptions, and feelings shape how individuals within the organization perceive and interact with each other and the external environment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and address these underlying assumptions and perceptions to create a more inclusive and diverse workplace.
Creating organizational diversity involves understanding the culture of the organization and identifying areas for improvement. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, addressing biases and stereotypes, and creating a culture that values and respects differences. To understand a culture, one must be a part of it and actively engage with the members to identify areas for improvement.
What is organizational culture made of?

An inclusive team environment is a work environment where every team member feels valued and respected, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or any other characteristic that may differentiate them from others. This type of environment is essential for promoting creativity and innovation within a team.
To create an inclusive team environment, it is essential to promote open and honest communication among team members. This means that team members should feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, opinions, and ideas without fear of judgment or ridicule. This approach fosters collaboration and encourages creative thinking.
Inclusive teams also recognize and value diversity. This means that team members should be encouraged to share their unique experiences and perspectives, as this can lead to new and innovative approaches to problem-solving. By valuing diversity, teams can avoid groupthink and create a more open and creative work environment.
It is also essential to provide equal opportunities and recognition to all team members. This means that team members should be recognized and rewarded for their contributions, regardless of their background or characteristics. Providing equal opportunities and recognition helps to create a sense of belonging and fosters a culture of inclusivity.
Inclusive teams also promote learning and growth. This means that team members should be encouraged to learn from each other, share their knowledge and experience, and support each other&apos;s professional development. By promoting learning and growth, teams can build a culture of continuous improvement and creativity.
Organizational cultures can also be classified based on national or regional differences. Here are some examples of four different cultural types: German, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, and Latin.
German organizational culture is characterized by a focus on hierarchy, stability, and predictability. In this type of culture, there is a strong emphasis on planning, efficiency, and reliability. Decision-making is often centralized, and there is a focus on following rules and procedures. Communication tends to be formal and respectful, and relationships are based on status and rank.
Scandinavian organizational culture is characterized by a focus on equality, collaboration, and consensus. In this type of culture, there is a strong emphasis on work-life balance, and individuals are encouraged to take responsibility for their own development. Decision-making is often decentralized, and there is a focus on open communication and consensus-building. Relationships are based on trust and mutual respect.
Anglo-Saxon organizational culture is characterized by a focus on individualism, competition, and entrepreneurship. In this type of culture, there is a strong emphasis on personal achievement and success, and individuals are encouraged to take risks and innovate. Decision-making is often based on market forces and competition, and there is a focus on individual autonomy and accountability. Communication tends to be informal and direct, and relationships are based on mutual benefit.
Latin organizational culture is characterized by a focus on relationships, personal connections, and emotions. In this type of culture, there is a strong emphasis on building personal relationships and trust, and decision-making is often influenced by personal connections and emotions. Communication tends to be informal and expressive, and relationships are based on reciprocity and mutual obligations.
Each type of culture has its own strengths and weaknesses. German culture can be efficient and stable but may struggle with adaptability and innovation. Scandinavian culture can foster collaboration and trust, but may be slow to make decisions. Anglo-Saxon culture can be innovative and entrepreneurial but may struggle with maintaining relationships and social cohesion. Latin culture can foster strong personal connections, but may be prone to nepotism and 
favoritism
.
Organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and principles that guide the 
behavior
 and actions of the members of an organization. It is a system of norms, practices, and unwritten rules that govern how people interact with each other and approach their work.
Organizational culture is created through a set of important community mutual agreements and understandings. It consists of patterns and ways of thinking, feeling, and reacting, acquired through language and symbols that create distinctiveness between groups of people.
The dominant group in an organization has a significant influence on shaping its culture. The culture that characterizes an organization can determine how people dress, communicate, and perform their work. Organizational culture is often described as the &quot;personality&quot; of the organization.
Charles Handy distinguished organizational cultures and their impact on leadership effectiveness:
Power Culture
This culture is similar to a spider web - the spider, sitting in the 
center
, oversees its entire ecosystem. As the power 
center
, the spider is surrounded by a circle of friends. Proximity to the spider 
center
 gives power to those who occupy such a position. Organizations with a power culture have many commonalities: they react very quickly to critical situations, as the team lines are very clear; they attract a certain profile of staff - power-oriented, politically-minded, and risk-loving individuals. Power in such an organizational culture is derived from the ability to manage resources. Individual success is measured by results. Such organizations are traditionally strict and abrasive. They often have low morale and high employee turnover. Success in such an environment is achieved when employees anticipate what their leaders expect of them and align results with the leader&apos;s expectations. Power culture organizations maintain strict and centralized financial management regimes.
Role Culture
A role culture organization is characterized as a building supported by columns and beams. Just as columns and beams are structurally important elements that perform a certain role in maintaining the structural integrity of a building, so do certain organizational roles have a significant impact on the organization. Organizations with a role culture have several characteristics: strong functional or specialized areas coordinated by a small group of senior staff at the top of the organization. This is manifested by a high level of formalization and standardization, official job descriptions, and accompanying authorities. High-ranking officials hold the power in such types of organizations. Political dynamics of power are not tolerated in this type of organizational culture. Rules and procedures define what is right to do. Subjects of this type work very well in an extremely stable environment, which is quite rare in this constantly changing world. Such an organization works well in those industries where technocracy is given priority over flexibility. Role culture subjects do not tolerate change very well. These organizations offer job security and the opportunity to deepen technical knowledge, but for young, ambitious, and career-minded members, such a culture is quite daunting.
Task Culture
Task culture is common in organizations that work extensively with projects. Often, such organizations will have a matrix organizational structure. In organizational cultures of this type, the main focus is on work performance. The work rubric is as follows: the necessary task is determined, the discussion is held on how to complete it in time, and the necessary resources are identified and concentrated. The task culture aims to ensure that teams are independent and self-sufficient, and that they can work without interference from others. In such an organizational culture, flexibility and adaptability are essential to success. This culture encourages creativity and innovation, as well as continuous learning and development. Task culture subjects prefer to work in a dynamic environment, where changes are expected and anticipated. They are motivated by the challenge and the opportunity to solve complex problems.
Person Culture
A schizoid culture
 is characterized by distance and mistrust at the top levels of management. There is a power vacuum at the lower levels of the organization, leading to struggles for position, coalitions, and informal groupings. Individuals may feel disconnected from the larger organization and lack a sense of shared purpose or direction.
An opportunistic culture
 is characterized by exclusivity and a tendency to offend. Individuals in such organizations may prioritize procedure over substance and be resistant to change or external input. The integration of values is based on exclusivity, and there may be a denial of individual cultures or perspectives.
A commitment culture
 is open and ready to integrate other differentiated cultures and exchange ideas. However, such a culture can also lead to conflicts of values and interests, and a significant amount of time and resources may be required to harmonize them. This culture can be beneficial in fostering creativity and innovation but can also lead to high costs and challenges in maintaining cohesion.
Freedom and flexibility are essential elements of a modern work environment. They refer to an approach where employees are given the freedom to work in their own way and are provided with the flexibility to balance their work and personal lives. This approach can help to increase productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction among employees.
Providing employees with freedom and flexibility means giving them the opportunity to choose when and where they work. This can be achieved through flexible working hours, remote work options, and the ability to work from home or another location. This approach allows employees to work when they are most productive and can help to reduce stress and burnout.
Another important aspect of freedom and flexibility is providing employees with the tools and resources they need to work effectively. This can include access to technology, training, and support from managers and colleagues. By providing employees with the necessary resources, they are better equipped to work independently and contribute to the success of the organization.
Freedom and flexibility also mean giving employees the opportunity to have a say in how they work. This can involve encouraging employees to contribute their ideas and suggestions for improving work processes and procedures. By involving employees in decision-making processes, organizations can create a culture of collaboration and innovation.
Creativity is a valuable resource in organizations, as it can drive innovation and help the organization to achieve its goals. Creativity refers to the ability to generate original ideas, solutions, and opportunities that can lead to improvements and growth.
From an organizational perspective, creativity is not just about generating new and innovative ideas, but also about the practical implementation of those ideas. Creative proposals must have a positive impact on the implementation of organizational goals, and be implemented in a way that aligns with the organization&apos;s values and objectives.
Creativity can be fostered within an organization through various methods, such as creating a supportive and open work environment, providing training and resources for employees to develop their skills and knowledge, and encouraging collaboration and the exchange of ideas.
In addition to being a valuable resource for the organization, creativity can also benefit employees by promoting engagement, job satisfaction, and a sense of purpose in their work. Employees who are encouraged to be creative and contribute to the organization&apos;s goals are more likely to feel valued and motivated.
However, there may also be challenges associated with fostering creativity in organizations, such as the risk of failure, resistance to change, and the need for resources and support. It is important for organizations to strike a balance between encouraging creativity and managing risk and resources effectively.
Edgar Schein is a renowned organizational psychologist who is best known for his model of organizational culture. According to Schein, organizational culture refers to the shared assumptions, values, beliefs, and 
behaviors
 that characterize an organization and guide the way individuals within it interact with each other and their external environment.
Schein&apos;s model of organizational culture is divided into three levels: artifacts, espoused values, and underlying assumptions.
Artifacts are the tangible and visible aspects of organizational culture, such as the physical environment, dress codes, language, and symbols. These artifacts serve as the most accessible and observable level of culture and provide insights into the deeper levels of culture.
Espoused values are the stated values, beliefs, and norms of an organization, which are often explicitly communicated through mission and vision statements, codes of conduct, and other formal documents. Espoused values are what the organization claims to value and uphold.
Underlying assumptions are the unconscious, implicit, and taken-for-granted beliefs, values, and assumptions that guide 
behavior
 and decision-making within an organization. These assumptions are often difficult to identify and change, as they are deeply ingrained in the culture.
Schein argues that all three levels of culture are interconnected, and change at one level can impact the other levels. For example, if an organization&apos;s artifacts, such as dress codes or symbols, are changed, this can also affect the underlying assumptions and beliefs of the organization. Similarly, if the underlying assumptions and values of the organization are shifted, this can result in changes to the espoused values and artifacts.
Schein&apos;s model is widely used to understand and manage organizational culture. It emphasizes the importance of understanding both the visible and invisible aspects of culture and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to cultural change. Schein&apos;s model can help organizations to identify areas for improvement and align their culture with their values and goals. It is also useful in creating a more inclusive and diverse workplace by identifying and addressing underlying assumptions and biases that may exist within the culture.

Artifacts Material symbols
Actual physical items that collectively communicate culture.
Language: How organizational members address each other, describe customers, express frustration, etc., are all symbols and perpetuators of organizational values. Organizational leaders use phrases, metaphors, and other vocabularies to communicate shared values and community.
Rituals and Ceremonies: These are the routines of daily organizational life that indicate an organization’s culture and values. Traditions usually begin with a purpose but soon to serve an identity affirming purpose.
Stories and Legends: Communicates culture when they describe real people, are true, and are well known. Also, stories teach us what to do or not to do.
Espoused and Enacted Values
Espoused Values do not represent an organization’s culture. Rather, they establish the public image (internal and external) that leaders want to 
display.Often
 articulated when you ask an organizational member about an 
artifactOften
 these lists of values are ambiguous and even contradictory Espoused Values, if effective and actualized, become “enacted values” and can eventually get deeply rooted enough to become 
assumptions.“The
 Most Central Issue for leaders, therefore, is how to get at the deeper levels of culture, how to assess the functionality of the assumptions made at that level, and how to deal with the anxiety that is unleased when those levels are challenged.” Schein, 2004
Underlying Assumptions
Basic assumptions have become so taken for granted that one finds little variation within a social unit. In fact, if an enacted value becomes an assumption organizational members will find based on any other assumption practically inconceivable.

Reality and Truth
Observing and understanding aspects of organizational culture is very important for various reasons.
Firstly, organizational culture plays a significant role in motivating employees and evaluating their performance. Employees who feel a sense of belonging and identification with their organization&apos;s culture are more engaged, committed, and productive. Therefore, nurturing a positive culture can contribute to better employee motivation, job satisfaction, and performance outcomes.
Secondly, organizational leaders set the tone for the culture. If they do not align their actions and decisions with the organization&apos;s cultural values and norms, it can cause distrust, disrespect, and non-compliance from other members. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that organizational leaders lead by example and embody the values they aim to promote.
Thirdly, individuals may not want to be part of an organization&apos;s culture if they believe it contradicts their values and morality. Therefore, it is crucial to consider ethical and moral aspects of culture and ensure that they align with an individual&apos;s personal values and beliefs. This can help attract and retain employees who share the same values and create a more inclusive and diverse workplace.
Fourthly, it is important to recognize that large organizations cannot have just one culture. Different subcultures may emerge based on different organizational functions, departments, or locations. Therefore, it is important to observe and understand different subcultures and ensure they align with the overall organizational culture.
Fifthly, national culture can have a significant influence on organizational culture. National culture refers to shared values, beliefs, and practices prevalent in a particular country or region. Therefore, it is important to recognize the influence of national culture and how it shapes organizational culture.
Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge that organizational culture is not something an organization has. Instead, it is something that the organization is. Culture is deeply embedded in an organization&apos;s history, traditions, and practices, making it very difficult to change. Changing organizational culture requires a long-term, comprehensive approach that includes identifying the current culture, defining the desired culture, and strategically implementing it.
Risk tolerance is an individual or organizational willingness to take on risks or uncertainties. It refers to the level of uncertainty or potential loss that an individual or organization is willing to accept in pursuit of a goal or objective. In a business context, risk tolerance can impact decision-making processes and can have significant implications for the success of an organization.
An individual or organization with a high level of risk tolerance is more willing to take on risks and uncertainties. They may be more likely to take on ambitious projects or invest in new ventures. High risk tolerance can lead to innovation and growth, but it also comes with the potential for significant losses or failure.
Conversely, an individual or organization with a low level of risk tolerance is more risk-averse. They may be more likely to avoid taking risks or to choose safer options. Low risk tolerance can provide a sense of security and stability, but it can also limit opportunities for growth and innovation.
Risk tolerance is influenced by a variety of factors, including personal or organizational values, financial resources, and past experiences. Understanding an individual or organization&apos;s risk tolerance is important in making strategic decisions and developing effective risk management strategies.
To effectively manage risk, it is important to balance risk tolerance with risk management strategies. This may involve identifying potential risks, evaluating their potential impact, and developing strategies to mitigate or manage them. Effective risk management can help individuals or organizations to achieve their goals while minimizing potential losses or negative outcomes.
