Theory
It is a set of interconnected concepts, ideas, definitions, and hypotheses that reflect a systematic view of phenomena and aim to explain and predict the relationships between variables.
Theory combines individual empirical data into a clear conceptual system whose essence is to give meaning to everything that is known about the phenomena under investigation.
Method

Tool
It can take many forms (tool, template, standard, format, skill, ability, formula, visualization, etc.) and is applied in the chosen method used.

Personality characteristics
Most people are passive and irrational,
Higher level needs for respect and self-actualization are ongoing needs that are never fully satisfied for most people.
Employees are loyal to their employer who genuinely cares about their personal development, health, and family.
Work
For most people, work is unpleasant by nature, so they will try to avoid work whenever possible.
Work can be as natural as play if the conditions are favorable.
Employees have faith in and take pride in their work, striving to do their best.
Responsibility
Most people are not ambitious, have little desire for responsibility, and want to be directed.
Employees seek responsibility under the right conditions.
Employees are encouraged to take collective responsibility and are expected to participate in making organizational decisions.
Changes, innovations
Most people have little creativity in solving organizational problems. Most people resist change.
Employees are creative and innovative by nature. They are eager for change.
Individual contributions are valued, but must always be considered in the context of the entire organization/team.
Control
Most people are egocentric. Therefore, they must be carefully controlled and often coerced to achieve organizational goals.
Employees prefer limited control and direction. They control and direct themselves.
Employees have the right to perform tasks as they see fit, but management is expected to establish formal means of assessing work quality and results.
Motivational tools
Motivation arises only at the physiological and safety levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Therefore, people are mostly motivated by monetary means.
People will be committed to achieving quality and productivity goals if they are given rewards that meet higher needs, such as self-actualization.
Employees need guaranteed employment and will accept slower evaluations.

Motivational
 
system
Motivation system and its development aspects
Motivation system
Includes a range of motivation methods, tools and processes that are integrated as a whole to encourage productive work.
The combination of financial and non-financial motivation measures
, which are aligned with the organization's culture, structure and management style, encourages employees to achieve the organization's goals.
Aspects of creating a motivation system
If the motivation system is developed correctly, the organization has a real chance to operate successfully and stay afloat.
Motivating factors stimulate different people differently
, so each manager faces the challenge of "awakening" a person's responsibility, autonomy and adequate feedback for the organization.
Since using the same motivation methods for a long time becomes ineffective, developing a motivation system is 
an ongoing process of improvement
.
Each organization's motivation system 
is unique
.
Motivation plays a very important role in the function of directing and involves the process of engaging, encouraging, and supporting employees to achieve organizational goals.
Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are essential components of employee motivation. Intrinsic motivation promotes personal satisfaction and long-term employee engagement, while extrinsic motivation helps achieve short-term goals through external rewards or punishments.
The wide variety of motivation theories highlights the complexity of human motivation and emphasizes that managers must adopt a flexible approach, understand and consider individual differences, organizational context, and cultural factors to effectively apply motivational strategies that engage and inspire employees to achieve the best results.
A well-designed motivational system is necessary to increase employee engagement and satisfaction. It must combine various motivational methods and tools, taking into account individual employee needs. It is crucial that the motivational system is regularly reviewed and updated.

Motivation: the driving force behind human 
behavior
Motivation is the strength of a person's inner desire to engage in a particular activity. It can be described as a combination of internal and external forces that influence a person's choice to behave in a certain way. These forces work together in a complex process that regulates an individual's actions and relationships with the environment.
As a process, motivation directs a person's 
behavior
 so that they can achieve important goals or satisfy their needs. This can involve various activities, such as pursuing a career, developing personal relationships, or pursuing hobbies. Motivation is not a constant state; rather, it is a dynamic and constantly changing aspect of a person's life that fluctuates depending on various factors, including personal experience, environmental conditions, and individual needs.
Motivation is an important subject of study in both psychology and management because understanding the key factors that influence human 
behavior
 can have significant implications for personal and professional development. Researchers seek to answer the question "Why does a person perform action x?" by examining various motivating factors. These can include internal factors such as personal interests, values, and passions, as well as external factors such as rewards, recognition, and social pressure.
In summary, motivation is a complex and multifaceted process that influences an individual's actions and interactions with the environment. By understanding the various factors that contribute to motivation, scientists and practitioners can develop strategies to help people achieve their goals and satisfy their needs more effectively. This knowledge can also be applied in various settings, such as the workplace, educational institutions, and personal development, to promote individual growth, success, and overall well-being.

A 
model
 
of
 
motivation
: 
understanding
 
the
 
interplay
 
of
 
key
 
elements
The
 
motivation
 
model
 
provides
 a 
framework
 
for
 
understanding
 
the
 
relationships
 
between
 
the
 
various
 
elements
 
that
 
contribute
 to 
human
 
motivation
. 
This
 
model
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
interaction
 
between
 
external
 
elements
 
of
 
social
 
management
 
systems
 
and
 
internal
 
individual
 
management
 
systems
. 
By
 
examining
 
these
 
elements
, 
we
 
can
 
understand
 
the
 
complex
 
dynamics
 
of
 
motivation
 
and
 
how
 it 
determines
 
human
 
behavior
.
External
 
social
 
control
 
system
: 
This
 
reflects
 
the
 
broader
 
social
 
context
 
in
 
which
 
an
 
individual
 
operates
, 
including
 
cultural
 
norms
, 
organizational
 
structures
, 
and
 
societal
 
expectations
. 
These
 
factors
 
can
 
shape
 a 
person's
 
motivation
 
by
 
influencing
 
their
 
perception
 
of
 
what
 
is
 
considered
 
valuable
, 
acceptable
, 
desirable
, 
or
 
useful
.
An
 
individual's
 
internal
 
control
 
system
: 
This
 
refers
 to a 
person's
 
unique
 
psychological
 
makeup
, 
including
 
their
 
personality
, 
beliefs
, 
and
 
attitudes
. 
This
 
system
 
plays
 a 
critical
 role 
in
 
determining
 
how
 a 
person
 
interprets
 
and
 
responds
 to 
external
 
stimuli
 
and
 
influences
 
their
 
motivation
.
Needs
: 
These
 are 
the
 
basic
 
requirements
 
that
 
individuals
 
must
 
meet
 to 
maintain
 
their
 
well-being
, 
such
 
as
 
physiological
 
needs
, 
safety
, 
social
 
connection
, 
self-esteem
, 
and
 
self-actualization
. 
Needs
 
can
 
drive
 
motivation
 
as
 
individuals
 
try
 to 
satisfy
 
them
 
through
 
various
 
actions
 
and
 
behaviors
.
Values
: 
These
 are 
the
 
basic
 
principles
 
that
 
people
 
value
 
that
 
shape
 
their
 
perception
 
of
 
what
 
is
 
important
 
and
 
meaningful
 
in
 
life
. 
Values
 
can
 
influence
 
motivation
 
by
 
directing
 
individuals
 
toward
 
actions
 
that
 are 
consistent
 
with
 
their
 
beliefs
 
and
 
priorities
.
Motives
 
and
 
Stimuli
: 
Motives
 are 
the
 
underlying
 
causes
 
of
 a 
person's
 
actions
, 
while
 
stimuli
 are 
the
 
external
 
factors
 
that
 
encourage
 
those
 
actions
. 
The
 
interplay
 
between
 
motives
 
and
 
stimuli
 
can
 
promote
 
or
 
hinder
 
motivation
, 
depending
 
on
 
how
 
they
 
match
 
the
 
individual's
 
needs
 
and
 
values
.
Action
: It 
refers
 to 
the
 
behaviors
 
and
 
activities
 
that
 
individuals
 
engage
 
in
 
in
 
an
 
attempt
 to 
satisfy
 
their
 
needs
, 
fulfill
 
their
 
values
, 
and
 
respond
 to 
stimuli
. 
The
 
relationship
 
between
 
motivation
 
and
 
action
 
is
 
dynamic
, 
motivation
 
drives
 
action
, 
and
 
action
, 
in
 
turn
, 
influences
 
future
 
motivation
.
Satisfaction
: 
When
 
an
 
individual's
 
actions
 
successfully
 
satisfy
 
his
 
needs
 
or
 
align
 
with
 
his
 
values
, 
he
 
experiences
 
satisfaction
. 
This
 
positive
 
outcome
 
can
 
increase
 
motivation
 
and
 
encourage
 
individuals
 to take 
similar
 
actions
 
in
 
the
 
future
.
Dissatisfaction
: 
Conversely
, 
when
 
an
 
individual's
 
actions
 
do
 
not
 
satisfy
 
his
 
needs
 
or
 
conflict
 
with
 
his
 
values
, 
he
 
experiences
 
dissatisfaction
. 
This
 
negative
 
outcome
 
may
 
reduce
 
motivation
 
or
 
prompt
 
individuals
 to 
reevaluate
 
their
 
motives
 
and
 
strategies
.
In
 
summary
, 
the
 
motivation
 
model
 
highlights
 
the
 
complex
 
interplay
 
of
 
various
 
elements
 
that
 
contribute
 to 
human
 
motivation
. 
By
 
understanding
 
the
 
relationships
 
between
 
these
 
elements
, 
we
 
can
 
gain
 a 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
factors
 
that
 
determine
 
human
 
behavior
 
and
 
develop
 
more
 
effective
 
strategies
 
for
 
promoting
 
motivation
 
and
 
personal
 
growth
.

Values
 are 
specific
 
characteristics
 
of
 
the
 
objects
 
and
 
meanings
 
of
 
the
 
world
 
around
 
us
, 
which
 
have
 a 
positive
 
meaning
 
for
 a 
person
, 
collective
, 
society
. 
Objects
 
and
 
phenomena
 
become
 
values
 
only
 
because
 
they
 are 
included
 
in
 
the
 
spheres
 
of
 
existence
 
of
 
human
 
society
. 
Therefore
, 
values
 are 
usually
 
objects
 
and
 
phenomena
 
dependent
 
on
 
society
, 
which
, 
satisfying
 
some
 
human
 
needs
 
and
 
interests
, 
have
 a 
positive
 
meaning

Intrinsic
 
and
 
extrinsic
 
motivation
 are 
two
 
essential
 
components
 
of
 
motivation
 
that
 
play
 a 
crucial
 role 
in
 
the
 
leadership
 
function
. 
Understanding
 
and
 
effectively
 
harnessing
 
both
 
types
 
of
 
motivation
 
can
 
help
 
managers
 
create
 a 
more
 
engaged
 
and
 
productive
 
workforce
.
Intrinsic
 
motivation
 
refers
 to 
an
 
internal
 
drive
 
that
 
results
 
from
 a 
person's
 
personal
 
satisfaction
, 
enjoyment
, 
and
 
interest
 
in
 a 
task
. 
Employees
 
who
 are 
intrinsically
 
motivated
 are 
more
 
engaged
, 
creative
 
and
 
committed
 to 
their
 
work
. 
They
 
derive
 
pleasure
 
from
 
the
 
learning
 
process
, 
mastering
 
skills
 
and
 
achieving
 
meaningful
 
goals
. 
Managers
 
can
 
stimulate
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 
by
 
providing
 
employees
 
with
 
challenging
 
tasks
, 
encouraging
 
personal
 
development
, 
and
 
recognizing
 
employees
' 
personal
 
achievements
. 
By
 
creating
 a 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
emphasizes
 
autonomy
, 
excellence
, 
and
 
purpose
, 
managers
 
can
 
tap
 
into
 
employees
' 
natural
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 
and
 
foster
 
long-term
 
success
.
Extrinsic
 
motivation
, 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand
, 
comes
 
from
 
external
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
rewards
 
or
 
punishments
. 
Examples
 
of
 
extrinsic
 
motivators
 
include
 
financial
 
incentives
, 
promotions
, 
and
 
performance
 
appraisals
. 
Although
 
extrinsic
 
motivation
 
can
 be 
effective
 
for
 
achieving
 
routine
 
tasks
 
and
 
short-term
 
goals
, 
an
 
overemphasis
 
on
 
extrinsic
 
rewards
 
can
 
reduce
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 
and
 
long-term
 
performance
.
In
 
order
 to 
effectively
 
execute
 
the
 
directing
 
function
, it 
is
 
essential
 
that
 
managers
 
understand
 
and
 
balance
 
aspects
 
of
 
intrinsic
 
and
 
extrinsic
 
motivation
.

A 
motivational
 
system
 
is
 a 
set
 
of
 
policies
, 
practices
, 
and
 
strategies
 
that
 
an
 
organization
 
implements
 to 
motivate
 
and
 
inspire
 
its
 
employees
 to 
perform
 at 
their
 best, 
stay
 
engaged
, 
and
 
contribute
 to 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
. 
Creating
 
an
 
effective
 
motivational
 
system
 
requires
 a 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
needs
, 
wishes
 
and
 
expectations
 
of
 
employees
, 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
values
, 
culture
 
and
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
organization
.
Some
 
important
 
aspects
 to 
consider
 
when
 
designing
 a 
motivational
 
system
:
Alignment
 
with
 
organizational
 
goals
: 
The
 
motivational
 
system
 
must
 
support
 
the
 
goals
 
and
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
organization
, 
and
 
the
 
individual
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
employee
 
must
 be 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
organization
.
Individual
 
differences
: 
Employees
 
have
 
different
 
needs
, 
preferences
 
and
 
motivators
. A 
flexible
 
system
 
needs
 to be 
developed
 
that
 
takes
 
into
 
account
 
these
 
differences
 
and
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
personality
, 
human
 
background
 
and
 
personal
 
values
.
Balance
 
of
 
intrinsic
 
and
 
extrinsic
 
motivators
: A 
combination
 
of
 
intrinsic
 
motivators
 (
such
 
as
 a 
sense
 
of
 
accomplishment
,

Management
: 
Theory
 
Understanding
, 
Methods
 
and
 
Tools
Motivation
 
is
 
an
 
essential
 
aspect
 
of
 
the
 
leadership
 
function
 
because
 it 
influences
 
employee
 
behavior
 
and
 
overall
 
performance
. 
In
 
order
 to 
effectively
 
motivate
 
employees
, 
managers
 
must
 be 
well
 
versed
 
in
 
motivational
 
theories
, 
methods
 
and
 
tools
. It 
is
 
important
 to 
note
 
that
 
theories
 
do
 
not
 
directly
 
explain
 
how
 to 
motivate
 
employees
; 
instead
, 
they
 
provide
 a 
basis
 
for
 
understanding
 
the
 
underlying
 
drivers
 
of
 
motivation
. 
Managers
 
must
 
then
 
apply
 
appropriate
 
methods
 
and
 
tools
 to put 
these
 
theories
 
into
 
practice
.
Theory
: 
Motivational
 
theories
 are 
collections
 
of
 
interrelated
 
concepts
, 
ideas
, 
definitions
, 
and
 
hypotheses
 
that
 
aim
 to 
explain
 
and
 
predict
 
the
 
phenomena
 
of
 
motivation
 
and
 
its
 
variable
 
relationships
. 
By
 
combining
 
discrete
 
empirical
 data 
into
 a 
clear
 
conceptual
 
framework
, 
theories
 
help
 
make
 
sense
 
of
 
all
 
that
 
is
 
known
 
about
 
the
 
studied
 
motivational
 
phenomena
. 
Examples
 
of
 
motivational
 
theories
 
include
 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
, 
Herzberg's
 
two-factor
 
theory
, 
and
 
expectancy
 
theory
. 
These
 
theories
 
provide
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
factors
 
that
 
drive
 
motivation
 
and
 
can
 
inform
 
management
 
strategies
.
Method
: 
Method
 
refers
 to 
the
 
way
 
in
 
which
 
something
 
is
 
done
. 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
motivation
, 
methods
 are 
the
 
ways
 
managers
 
use
 to 
implement
 
motivational
 
theories
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
. 
These
 
methods
 are 
based
 
on
 
an
 
understanding
 
of
 
motivation
 
derived
 
from
 
theories
 
and
 are 
tailored
 to 
meet
 
the
 
specific
 
needs
, 
values
 
and
 
goals
 
of
 
employees
. 
Examples
 
of
 
motivational
 
techniques
 
include
 
setting
 
goals
, 
providing

work
 
environment
.
Tools
: are 
specific
, 
tangible
 
resources
 
or
 
instruments
 
used
 to 
implement
 
the
 
chosen
 
methods

motivate
 
employees
, it 
is
 
necessary
 to 
understand
 
the
 
differences
 
between
 
motivational
 
theories
, 
methods
 
and
 
tools
. 
Theories
 
provide
 
basic
 
knowledge
 
about
 
motivation
, 
and
 
methods
 are 
the
 
ways
 
in
 
which
 
managers
 
apply
 
this
 
knowledge
 
in

Motivational
 
theories
 are 
fundamental
 
frameworks
 
for
 
understanding
 
what
 
drives
 
human
 
behavior
, 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
. 
These
 
theories
 
can
 be 
broadly
 
divided
 
into
 
two
 
groups
: 
content
 
theories
 
and
 
process
 
theories
.
Content
 
Theories
 
of
 
Motivation
:
Content
 
theories
 
focus
 
on
 
identifying
 
specific
 
motivational
 
factors
 
or
 
needs
. 
These
 
theories
 
suggest
 
that
 
individuals
 are 
motivated
 to 
act
 
in
 
certain
 
ways
 to 
satisfy
 
their
 
inherent
 
needs
, 
which
 
can
 range 
from
 
basic
 
physiological
 
demands
 to 
higher-level
 
psychological
 
desires

theories
, 
in
 
contrast
, 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
cognitive
 
processes
 
and
 
mechanisms

motivation
, 
examining
 
how
 
individuals
 
make
 
decisions
 
about
 
their
 
goals
 
and
 
actions

Some
 
prominent
 
process
 
theories
 
include

motivational
 
theories
 
provide
 
additional
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
factors
 
and
 
mechanisms
 
that
 
drive
 
human
 
motivation

A

Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
is
 a 
psychological
 
theory
 
that
 
distinguishes
 
lower
 (
biological
, 
physiological
) 
and
 
higher
 (
social
, 
spiritual
) 
needs
. It 
states
 
that
 
people
 are 
motivated
 to 
satisfy
 
their
 
needs
 
in
 a 
hierarchical
 
order
, 
starting
 
with
 
the
 
most
 
basic
 
needs
 
and
 
ending
 
with
 
more
 
complex
 
desires
. 
By
 
understanding
 
this
 
hierarchy
, 
managers
 
can
 
create
 
an
 
environment
 
that
 
meets
 
the
 
diverse
 
needs
 
of
 
their
 
employees
 
and
 
fosters
 a 
more
 
motivated
 
and
 
productive
 
workforce
.
The
 
five
 
levels
 
of
 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 are:
Physiological
 
Needs
: Basic 
and
 
essential
 
survival
 
requirements
 
such
 
as
 
air
, 
water
, 
food
, 
sleep
 
and
 
protection
 
from
 
extreme
 
temperatures
. To 
meet
 
these
 
needs
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
, 
managers
 
should
 
ensure
 
fair
 
wages
, 
clean
 
air
, 
comfortable
 
workplaces
 
and
 
adequate
 
breaks
 
for
 
meals
 
and
 
rest
, etc.
Safety
 
Needs
: 
These
 
include
 
the
 
desire
 
for
 
safety
, 
stability
, 
and
 
protection
 
from
 
physical
 
and
 
emotional
 
threats
. 
Managers
 
can
 
meet
 
safety
 
needs
 
by
 
providing
 a 
safe
 
work
 
environment
, 
providing
 
safe
 
equipment
, 
legal
 
security
, 
and
 
establishing
 
benefits
, 
pensions
, 
and
 
medical
 
assistance
 
programs
.
Social
 
needs
: 
the
 
need
 
for
 
love
, 
belonging
, 
and
 
emotional
 
connection
, 
satisfied
 
by
 
interacting
 
with
 
others
, 
forming
 
attachments
, 
and
 
participating
 
in
 
groups
 
or
 
teams
. 
Managers
 
can
 
foster
 
social
 
needs
 
by
 
fostering
 a 
stable
 
and
 
supportive
 
group
 
environment
, 
encouraging
 
teamwork
 
and
 
communication
, 
and
 
organizing
 
team-building
 
activities
 
such
 
as
 
sports
 
competitions
 
and
 
trips
.
Esteem
 
needs
: 
the
 
desire
 
for
 
self-esteem
, 
respect
 
and
 
recognition
 
from
 
others
. 
Managers
 
can
 
meet
 
these
 
needs
 
by
 
assigning
 
important
 
tasks
, 
offering
 
responsibility
, 
involving
 
employees
 
in
 
decision-making
, 
providing
 
opportunities
 
for
 
career
 
advancement
 
and
 
skill
 
development
, 
and
 
implementing
 
both
 
monetary
 
and
 
non-monetary
 
reward
 
systems
.
Self-actualization
 
needs
: 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
of
 
the
 
hierarchy
, 
which
 
includes
 
the
 
desire
 
for
 
self-improvement
, 
personal
 
growth
, 
and
 
the
 
realization
 
of
 
one's
 
full
 
potential
. 
Managers
 
can
 
support
 
self-actualization
 
by
 
assigning
 
challenging
 
tasks
, 
offering
 
opportunities
 
for
 
creativity
 
and
 risk-
taking
, 
and
 
providing
 
opportunities
 
for
 
professional
 
development
 
and
 
advancement
.
According
 to 
Maslow
, 
unsatisfied
 
needs
 
motivate
 
action
 to 
satisfy
 
them
. 
And
 
when
 a 
need
 
is
 
satisfied
, 
higher
 
level
 
needs
 
arise
. 
Satisfying
 
lower-level
 
needs
 
creates
 
the
 
conditions
 
for
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
higher-level
 
needs
. 
As
 
individuals
 
progress
 
up
 
the
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
and
 
devote
 
more
 
time
 to 
personal
 
development
, 
their
 
attention
 
shifts
 to 
more
 
complex
 
and
 
varied
 
activities
.
In
 
practice
, 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
can
 
help
 
managers
 
create
 a 
motivating
 
work
 
environment
. 
By
 
addressing
 
each
 
level
 
of
 
need
 
with
 
the
 
right
 
methods
 
and
 
tools
, 
managers
 
can
 
ensure
 
that
 
their
 
employees
 
feel
 
supported
, 
valued
 
and
 
engaged
, 
which
 
will
 
ultimately
 
increase
 
productivity
 
and
 
job
 
satisfaction
.
Criticism
 
of
 
Maslow's
 
Hierarchy
 
of
 
Needs
 
Theory
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
is
 
widely
 
recognized
 
in
 
management
 
theory
 
and
 
is
 
often
 
used
 to 
understand
 
consumer
 
behavior
 
and
 
employee
 
motivation
. 
However
, 
the
 
theory
 
is
 
criticized
 
on
 
various
 
grounds
.
Cultural
 
Constraints
: 
The
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
may
 
not
 
accurately
 
reflect
 
the
 
priorities
 
and
 
values
 
of
 
individuals
 
from
 
different
 
cultural
 
backgrounds
. 
Although
 
the
 
theory
 
may
 be 
more
 
applicable
 
in
 a 
consumer-driven
 
society
, it 
may
 
not
 
fully
 
reflect
 
the
 
needs
 
and
 
motivations
 
of
 
individuals
 
in
 
other
 
cultural
 
domains
.
Behavioral
 
predictability
: 
The
 
theory
 
does
 
not
 
clearly
 
state
 
how
 
employees
 
will
 
behave
 
when
 
specific
 
needs
 
arise
. 
Although
 it 
provides
 a 
framework
 
for
 
understanding
 
what
 
motivates
 
employees
 to 
perform
 
more
 
effectively
, it 
does
 
not
 
provide
 
specific
 
guidance
 
on
 
how
 to 
effectively
 
meet
 
these
 
needs
 
or
 
predict
 
the
 
outcomes
 
of
 
various
 
motivational
 
strategies
.
Motivation
 
as
 a 
dynamic
 
process
: 
Maslow's
 
theory
 
ignores
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
motivation
 
is
 
not
 a 
permanent
 
state
. 
As
 
the
 
external
 
environment
 
and
 a 
person's
 
circumstances
 
change
, 
his
 
needs
 
and
 
desires
 
may
 
change
, 
so
 
managers
 
must
 
constantly
 
analyze
 
and
 
adjust
 
their
 
motivational
 
strategies
.
Managing
 
Diversity
: 
In
 
today's
 
globalized
 
work
 
environment
, 
managers
 are 
often
 
challenged
 to 
work
 
with
 
individuals
 
with
 
diverse
 
needs
, 
cultural
 
backgrounds
, 
ages
 
and
 
beliefs
. 
Maslow's
 
theory
 
does
 
not
 
fully
 
address
 
this
 
complexity
, 
making
 it 
difficult
 
for
 
managers
 to 
adapt
 
the
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 to 
meet
 
the
 
unique
 
requirements
 
of
 
each
 
employee
.
Hierarchy
 
Movement
: 
Maslow's
 
theory
 
assumes
 
that
 
individuals
 
move
 
up
 
the
 
hierarchy
, 
but
 
ignores
 
circumstances
 
that
 
may
 
cause
 
them
 to 
shift
 
attention
 to 
lower-level
 
needs
. 
This
 
limits
 
the
 
theory's
 
ability
 to 
explain
 
the
 
dynamic
 
nature
 
of
 
human
 
motivation
 
and
 
adaptation
 to 
changing
 
circumstances
.
In
 
conclusion
, 
although
 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
 
provides
 a 
basis
 
for
 
understanding
 
human
 
motivation
, it 
has
 
been
 
criticized
 
for
 
its
 
limitations
 
in
 
addressing
 
the
 
complexities
 
of
 
various
 
cultural
 
contexts
 
in
 
predicting
 
employee
 
behavior
.

The
 
Evolution
 
of
 
Motivational
 
Theories
: 
Theory
 X, 
Theory
 Y, 
and
 
Theory
 
Z
1960 
Douglas
 
McGregor
 
introduced
 
two
 
opposing
 
concepts
 
of
 
motivation
 
and
 
human
 
organization
, 
Theory
 X 
and
 
Theory
 Y. 
These
 
theories
 
provided
 a 
basis
 
for
 
understanding
 
employee
 
behavior
 
and
 
motivation
. 
William
 
Ouchi
 
later
 
developed
 
Theory
 
Z
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
, 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
good
 
interpersonal
 
relationships
 
in
 
an
 
organization
.
Theory
 X 
states
 
that
 
individuals
 are 
naturally
 
lazy
 
and
 
avoid
 
work
 
and
 
responsibility
. 
Hence
, 
strict
 
control
 
and
 
supervision
 
is
 
required
 to 
ensure
 
effectiveness
. 
This
 
approach
 
contradicts
 
Theory
 Y, 
which
 
states
 
that
 
people
 are 
responsible
, 
seek
 
good
 
relationships
, 
recognition
 
and
 
self-expression
 at 
work
.
According
 to 
Theory
 Y, 
organizations
 
need
 a 
positive
 
psychological
 
climate
 
and
 
alignment
 
with
 
employee
 
goals
. 
McGregor
 
believed
 
that
 
Theory
 X 
was
 
appropriate
 
for
 
certain
 
situations
, 
such
 
as
 
mass
 
industrial
 
production
, 
while
 
Theory
 Y 
was
 
more
 
appropriate
 
for
 
organizations
 
that
 
engaged
 
in
 
intellectual
 
activities
.
Theory
 
Z
 
emerged
 
as
 
an
 
alternative
 to 
theories
 X 
and
 Y, 
emphasizing
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
strong
 
human
 
relationships
 
in
 
organizations
. 
This
 
theory
, 
developed
 
by
 
William
 
Ouchi
, 
states
 
that
 
employee
 
loyalty
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
work
 are 
guaranteed
 
by
 
good
 
relationships
, 
respect
 
and
 
support
 
from
 
employers
. 
According
 to 
Theory
 
Z
, 
managers
 
should
 
create
 a 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
respects
 
employees
' 
cultural
 
values
 
and
 
traditions
 
while
 
caring
 
for
 
their
 
families
. 
Such
 
an
 
approach
 
promotes
 
employee
 
confidence
, 
satisfaction
, 
and
 a 
high
 
sense
 
of
 
self-discipline
 
and
 
duty
. 
In
 
order
 to 
increase
 
loyalty
, 
long-term
 
employment
 
and
 
collective
 
decision-making
 are 
encouraged
.
In
 
summary
, 
McGregor's
 
Theory
 X 
and
 
Theory
 Y, 
followed
 
by
 
Ouchi's
 
Theory
 
Z
, 
have
 
significantly
 
influenced
 
the
 
understanding
 
of
 
employee
 
motivation
 
and
 
organizational
 
behavior
. 
These
 
theories
 
emphasize
 
different
 
management
 
approaches
 
based
 
on
 
different
 
assumptions
 
about
 
human
 
nature
, 
emphasizing
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
adapting
 
strategies
 to 
specific
 
situations
 
and
 
work
 
environments
.
13
Based
 
on
 
Abraham
 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
, 
Fredrick
 
Herzberg
 
developed
 
the
 
motivation-hygiene
 
theory
, 
which
 
distinguishes
 
between
 
factors
 
that
 
contribute
 to 
job
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
those
 
that
 
cause
 
job
 
dissatisfaction
.
According
 to 
Herzberg
, 
dissatisfaction
 
factors
 
or
 "
hygiene
" 
factors
 
include
 
wages
, 
working
 
conditions
, 
employee
 
relations
, 
and
 
organizational
 
policies
, 
all
 
of
 
which
 
determine
 
the
 
work
 
environment
. 
Although
 a 
positive
 
assessment
 
of
 
these
 
factors
 
does
 
not
 
in
 
itself
 
lead
 to 
job
 
satisfaction
, it 
eliminates
 
dissatisfaction
. 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand
, 
satisfaction
 
factors
, 
or
 
motivational
 
factors
, are 
related
 to 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
job
, 
such
 
as
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
responsibility
, 
promotion
 
opportunities
, 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
job
 
itself
, 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
achievement
, 
and
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
recognition
. 
Herzberg
 
argues
 
that
 
these
 
factors
 
motivate
 
people
 to 
work
 
productively
.
Herzberg's
 
two-factor
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
job
 
dissatisfaction
 are 
not
 
simply
 
opposites
. 
Rather
, 
the
 
opposite
 
of
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
is
 a 
lack
 
of
 
dissatisfaction
, 
and
 
the
 
opposite
 
of
 
job
 
dissatisfaction
 
is
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
dissatisfaction
. 
This
 
theory
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
recognizing
 
individual
 
differences
 
when
 
applying
 
motivational
 
techniques
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
.
According
 to 
this
 
theory
, 
managers
 
should
 
first
 
address
 
job
 
dissatisfaction
 
by
 
addressing
 
hygiene
 
factors
, 
such
 
as
 
improving
 
working
 
conditions
 
and
 
offering
 
fair
 
wages
. 
When
 
dissatisfaction
 
is
 
minimized
, 
managers
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
satisfying
 
higher
 
needs
 
and
 
motivating
 
employees
 
through
 
motivational
 
factors
. 
This
 
approach
 
involves
 
providing
 
employees
 
with
 a 
balanced
 
set
 
of
 
hygiene
 
and
 
motivational
 
factors
 
that
 
meet
 
their
 
individual
 
needs
.
One 
application
 
of
 
Herzberg's
 
theory
 
is
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 "
vertical
 
job
 
enrichment
," 
where
 
work
 
is
 
given
 
both
 
hygienic
 
and
 
motivational
 
qualities
 
that
 
allow
 
employees
 to 
experience
 
achievement
, 
recognition
, 
responsibility
, 
promotion
, 
and
 
development
. 
In
 
contrast
, "
horizontal
 
job
 
enrichment
" 
involves
 
assigning
 
tasks
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
of
 
difficulty
 
but
 
different
 
content
.
The
 
main
 
principles
 
of
 
vertical
 
job
 
enrichment
 are:
Reducing
 
control
 
while
 
maintaining
 
accountability
Increasing
 
individual
 
responsibility
 
for
 
work
Establishing
 a 
clearly
 
defined
 
field
 
of
 
activity
Granting
 
additional
 
powers
 to 
employees
 
in
 
their
 
field
 
of
 
activity
Allowing
 
employees
 to 
report
 
directly
 to 
upper
 
management
 
rather
 
than
 
their
 
immediate
 
supervisor
Assigning
 
new
 
and
 
specialized
 
tasks
 
that
 
allow
 
employees
 to 
become
 
experts
By
 
incorporating
 
motivational
 
characteristics
 
such
 
as
 
responsibility
, 
achievement
, 
recognition
, 
and
 
development
, 
vertical
 
job
 
enrichment
 
promotes
 a 
more
 
satisfying
 
and
 
productive
 
work
 
environment
.
15
Alderfer's
 ERG 
theory
 
is
 
an
 
improvement
 
of
 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
, 
which
 
rearranges
 
the
 
five
 
levels
 
of
 
Maslow's
 
pyramid
 
into
 
three
 
groups
: 
existence
 
needs
, 
belongingness
 
needs
 
and
 
growth
 
needs
 (ERG - 
Existence
, 
Relatedness
, 
Growth
).
Existence
 
needs
 
correspond
 to 
Maslow's
 
physiological
 
and
 
safety
 
needs
, 
reflecting
 
the
 
basic
 
requirements
 
for
 
survival
 
and
 
security
.
Belongingness
 
needs
 
include
 
the
 
desire
 
for
 
emotional
 
connections
, 
interpersonal
 
relationships
, 
belonging
 to a 
group
, 
recognition
, 
and
 
fame
.
Growth
 
needs
 
include
 
personal
 
development
, 
self-improvement
 
and
 
realization
 
of
 
creativity
.
 
In
 
Alderfer's
 ERG 
theory
, 
the
 
movement
 
between
 
different
 
needs
 
is
 
more
 
dynamic
 
and
 
flexible
 
compared
 to 
Maslow's
 
hierarchy
 
of
 
needs
. ERG 
theory
 
recognizes
 
that
 
individuals
 
may
 
pursue
 
different
 
needs
 at 
the
 
same
 
time
 
and
 
may
 
switch
 
between
 
needs
 
in
 
response
 to 
changing
 
circumstances
. 
Movements
 
between
 
needs
 
can
 be 
described
 
as
 
follows
:
Satisfaction
 – 
Progression
:
When
 
an
 
individual's
 
lower
 
level
 
needs
 are 
satisfied
, 
they
 
tend
 to 
focus
 
on
 
higher
 
level
 
needs
. 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee's
 
existential
 
needs
 (
e.g
., 
salary
 
and
 
job
 
security
) are 
met
, 
he
 
or
 
she
 
is
 
more
 
likely
 to 
focus
 
on
 
belongingness
 
needs
 (
e.g
., 
social
 
connections
, 
recognition
) 
or
 
growth
 
needs
 (
e.g
., 
personal
 
development
, 
career
 
advancement
).
Frustration
 – 
Regression
:
When
 
higher
 
level
 
needs
 are 
not
 
met
 
or
 
frustrated
, 
the
 
individual
 
may
 
focus
 
on
 
lower
 
level
 
needs
. 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee
 
feels
 
that
 
they
 are 
not
 
being
 
given
 
enough
 
opportunities
 
for
 
personal
 
growth
 
and
 
development
, 
they
 
may
 
begin
 to 
focus
 
more
 
on
 
relational
 
needs
, 
seek
 
stronger
 
connections
 
with
 
colleagues
, 
or
 
even
 
revert
 to 
existential
 
needs
, 
demanding
 
higher
 
wages
 
or
 
better
 
working
 
conditions
.
Strengthening
:
In
 
some
 
cases
, 
when
 a 
lower-level
 
need
 
is
 
unsatisfied
, it 
can
 
reinforce
 
the
 
desire
 to 
satisfy
 
that
 
need
 
category
. 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee's
 
existential
 
needs
 are 
not
 
adequately
 
met
, 
he
 
may
 
become
 
increasingly
 
concerned
 
about
 
his
 
financial
 
security
 
or
 
job
 
stability
.
In
 
practice
, 
managers
 
should
 
pay
 
attention
 to 
the
 
dynamic
 
nature
 
of
 
human
 
needs
 
and
 
monitor
 
employee
 
satisfaction
 
levels
 
in
 
the
 
categories
 
of
 
existence
, 
belonging
, 
and
 
growth
. 
By
 
understanding
 
and
 
addressing
 
the
 
diverse
 
needs
 
of
 
their
 
employees
, 
managers
 
can
 
create
 a 
more
 
motivated
 
and
 
engaged
 
team
. It 
is
 
essential
 to 
recognize
 
signs
 
of
 
frustration
 
or
 
regression
 
and
 take 
appropriate
 
action
 
so
 
that
 
employees
 
can
 
pursue
 
higher
 
level
 
needs
 
and
 
remain
 
satisfied
 at 
work
.

McClelland's
 
theory
, also 
known
 
as
 
needs
 
theory
 
or
 
acquired
 
needs
 
theory
, 
was
 
developed
 
by
 
psychologist
 
David
 
McClelland
 
in
 
the
 1960s. 
The
 
theory
 
focuses
 
on
 
three
 
basic
 
needs
 
that
 
influence
 
human
 
motivation
 
and
 
behavior
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
. 
These
 
needs
 are 
not
 
innate
, 
they
 are 
learned
 
and
 
acquired
 
through
 
life
 
experiences
, 
cultural
 
environment
 
and
 
social
 
interactions
. 
The
 
three
 
needs
 are:
Demand
 
for
 
achievements
 (
nAch
):
This
 
need
 
refers
 to a 
person's
 
desire
 to 
achieve
 
challenging
 
goals
, to 
improve
 
in
 
their
 
work
 
and
 to 
continuously
 
improve
 
their
 
performance
. 
People
 
with
 a 
high
 
need
 
for
 
achievement
 are 
driven
 
by
 a 
sense
 
of
 
achievement
 
and
 take 
personal
 
responsibility
 
for
 
their
 
own
 
success
. 
They
 
tend
 to 
set
 
realistic
 
but
 
challenging
 
goals
 
and
 
choose
 to 
work
 
independently
 
or
 
with
 
other
 
high
 
achievers
.
Need
 
for
 
affiliation
 (
nAff
):
This
 
need
 
is
 
characterized
 
by
 
the
 
desire
 to 
establish
 
and
 
maintain
 
positive
 
social
 
relationships
, to 
seek
 
the
 
approval
 
of
 
others
, to be 
part
 
of
 a 
group
 
or
 
team
. 
People
 
with
 a 
high
 
need
 
for
 
belonging
 are 
motivated
 
by
 a 
sense
 
of
 
belonging
 to a 
team
, 
interpersonal
 
connections
, 
and
 
harmonious
 
relationships
. 
They
 
generally
 
prefer
 a 
collaborative
 
work
 
environment
 
and
 
maintaining
 
good
 
relationships
 
over
 
pursuing
 
personal
 
or
 
organizational
 
goals
.
Power 
Demand
 (
nPow
):
This
 
need
 
refers
 to 
an
 
individual's
 
desire
 to 
influence
, 
control
 
or
 
lead
 
others
, to 
influence
 
their
 
environment
. 
People
 
with
 a 
high
 
need
 
for
 
power
 are 
motivated
 
by
 
the
 
ability
 to 
make
 
decisions
, 
lead
 
others
, 
and
 
have
 
authority
. Power 
needs
 are 
of
 
two
 
types
: 
personal
 
power
 (
focused
 
on
 
personal
 
gain
 
and
 
control
) 
and
 
social
 
power
 (
focused
 
on
 
the
 
ability
 to 
influence
 
and
 
help
 
others
).
According
 to 
McClelland's
 
theory
, 
each
 
individual
 
has
 a 
unique
 
combination
 
of
 
these
 
needs
 
that
 
can
 
change
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
situation
. 
The
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
understanding
 
and
 
satisfying
 
these
 
needs
 
can
 
help
 
managers
 
adapt
 
their
 
motivational
 
strategies
 
and
 
create
 a 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
encourages
 
employees
 to 
perform
 at 
their
 best.
For
 
example
, 
employees
 
with
 a 
high
 
need
 
for
 
achievement
 
may
 
respond
 
well
 to 
challenging
 
projects
, 
performance-based
 
rewards
, 
and
 
regular
 
feedback
 
on
 
their
 
performance
. 
Those
 
who
 
need
 
social
 
connection
 
may
 
thrive
 
in
 a 
team
 
environment
 
where
 
there
 are 
opportunities
 
for
 
collaboration
 
and
 
communication
. 
Employees
 
with
 a 
high
 
need
 
for
 
power
 
may
 be 
motivated
 
by
 
increased
 
responsibility
, 
decision-making
 
authority
, 
or
 
leadership
 
positions
.

Three
 
main
 
motivational
 
factors
: 1) 
need
 
for
 
achievement
 (
results
/
success
); 2) 
the
 
need
 
for
 
power
 (
authority
/
influence
); 3) 
belonging
 (
interrelationship
).
These
 
needs
 are 
present
 
in
 
every
 
person
, 
but
 
one
 
may
 dominate 
more
 
or
 be 
expressed
 
differently
 (
for
 
example
, 
the
 
need
 
for
 
power
 
may
 
manifest
 
as
 a 
desire
 to 
obtain
 a 
higher
 
position
 
or
 to 
influence
 
the
 
opinion
 
of
 
important
 
persons
).
Practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
application
:
Managers
 
must
 
determine
 
which
 
motivating
 
factor
 
is
 dominant 
in
 
an
 
employee
, 
and
 
accordingly
 
formulate
 
goals
 
for
 
that
 
person
, 
give
 
feedback
, 
define
 
the
 
functional
 
areas
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
performed
, 
and
 
select
 
the
 
appropriate
 
reward

Goal-setting
 
theory
 
is
 a 
theory
 
of
 
motivation
 
developed
 
by
 
psychologists
 
Edwin
 
Locke
 
and
 
Gary
 
Latham
 
in
 
the
 1960s. 
The
 
theory
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
setting
 
specific
, 
challenging
, 
and
 
attainable
 
goals
 to 
enhance
 
motivation
 
and
 
improve
 
performance
. 
According
 to 
the
 
theory
, 
goals
 
influence
 
behavior
 
in
 
several
 
ways
:
Direction
: 
Goals
 
help
 
individuals
 
focus
 
their
 
attention
 
and
 
effort
 
on
 
relevant
 
activities
 
and
 
tasks
, 
directing
 
their
 
actions
 
toward
 
desired
 
outcomes
.
Effort
: 
Challenging
 
goals
 
increase
 
effort
 
as
 
individuals
 
strive
 to 
achieve
 
them
. 
People
 are 
more
 
likely
 to 
exert
 
more
 
effort
 
when
 
they
 
have
 a 
difficult
 
goal
 
than
 
when
 
they
 
have
 
no
 
goal
 
or
 
an
 
easy
 
goal
.
Persistence
: 
Goals
 
promote
 
persistence
 
because
 
people
 are 
more
 
likely
 to 
pursue
 a 
goal
 
when
 
they
 are 
focused
 
on
 a 
specific
 
outcome
.
Task
 
Strategies
: 
Goals
 
motivate
 
individuals
 to 
develop
 
and
 
apply
 
new
 
strategies
, 
techniques
, 
or
 
problem-solving
 
techniques
 to 
achieve
 
their
 
goals
.
Goal-setting
 
theory
 also 
identifies
 
several
 
factors
 
that
 
can
 
increase
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
goal-setting
:
Clarity
: 
Specific
 
goals
 are 
more
 
effective
 
than
 
vague
 
or
 
general
 
goals
 
because
 
they
 
provide
 
clarity
 
of
 
purpose
 
and
 
make
 it 
easier
 
for
 
individuals
 to 
track
 
their
 
progress
.
Challenges
: 
Difficult
 
goals
 are 
more
 
motivating
 
than
 
easy
 
ones
 
because
 
they
 
require
 
people
 to 
develop
 
their
 
abilities
 
and
 
when
 
they
 are 
achieved
, 
they
 
feel
 a 
greater
 
sense
 
of
 
accomplishment
. 
However
, 
goals
 
must
 
still
 be 
achievable
; 
if
 a 
goal
 
is
 
perceived
 
as
 
impossible
, it 
can
 
have
 a 
demotivating
 
effect
.
Realistic
: 
Objectives
 
must
 be 
achievable
 
and
 
realistic
, 
given
 
capabilities
 
and
 
resources
. 
Setting
 
unrealistic
 
goals
 
can
 
lead
 to 
frustration
 
and
 
demotivation
, 
as
 
individuals
 
may
 
perceive
 
the
 
goal
 
as
 
impossible
 to 
achieve
.
Commitment
: 
Individuals
 
must
 be 
committed
 to 
their
 
goals
 
in
 
order
 to be 
motivated
 to 
achieve
 
them
. 
Greater
 
commitment
 
can
 be 
achieved
 
by
 
engaging
 
in
 
goal
 
pursuit
, 
realizing
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
the
 
goal
, 
and
 
believing
 
in
 
one's
 
ability
 to 
achieve
 
the
 
goal
.
Feedback
: 
Providing
 
feedback
 
on
 
goal
 
progress
 
helps
 
individuals
 
adjust
 
their
 
efforts
 
and
 
strategies
 to 
further
 
their
 
goals
. 
Regular
 
feedback
 
can
 
increase
 
commitment
 
and
 
motivation
.
In
 
summary
, 
goal-setting
 
theory
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
setting
 
specific
, 
challenging
, 
and
 
attainable
 
goals
 
in
 
order
 to 
increase
 
motivation
 
and
 
productivity
. 
By
 
understanding
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
this
 
theory
, 
managers
 
can
 
create
 
effective
 
goal-setting
 
processes
 
and
 
create
 a 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
helps
 
employees
 
achieve
 
their
 
goals
.
---
The
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
setting
 a 
goal
 
or
 
intention
 
in
 
itself
 
strongly
 
influences
 
behavior
 
and
 
is
 a 
driving
 force 
behind
 
motivation
.
The
 
more
 
clearly
 
and
 
precisely
 
the
 
goals
 are 
formulated
, 
the
 
more
 
the
 
performance
 
improves
.
Practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
application
:
Managers
 
must
 
require
 
subordinates
 to 
set
 
goals
 
or
 
clearly
 
set
 a 
goal
/
task
 
for
 
them
. 
Then
 
you
 
can
 
expect
 
that
 
the
 
work
 
will
 be 
done
 
quickly
 
and
 
efficiently
. 
Problems
 
arise
 
when
 it 
is
 
difficult
 
for
 
an
 
employee
 to 
set
 a 
goal
 
on
 
his
 
own
. 
There
 
is
 
no
 
evidence
 
that
 
clearly
 
perceived
 
goals
 
lead
 to 
job
 
satisfaction
.
18
Reinforcement
 
theory
, 
developed
 
by
 
psychologist
 B.F. 
Skinner
, 
is
 a 
behavioral
 
theory
 
that
 
helps
 
us
 
understand
 
motivation
. 
Reinforcement
 
theory
 
is
 
not
 
exactly
 a 
theory
 
of
 
motivation
, 
but
 
more
 
of
 a 
theory
 
of
 
behavior
 
regulation
. It 
does
 
not
 
really
 take 
into
 
account
 
the
 
internal
 
factors
 
of
 a 
particular
 
person
, 
and
 
everything
 
is
 
explained
 
by
 
external
 
influences
. It 
is
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
principle
 
that
 
an
 
individual's
 
behavior
 
is
 
shaped
 
by
 
the
 
consequences
 
of
 
his
 
actions
. 
The
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
people
 are 
more
 
likely
 to 
repeat
 
behaviors
 
that
 
have
 
positive
 
outcomes
 
and
 
avoid
 
behaviors
 
that
 
have
 
negative
 
consequences
. 
Reinforcement
 
theory
 
focuses
 
on
 
four
 
main
 
concepts
: 
positive
 
reinforcement
, 
negative
 
reinforcement
, 
punishment
, 
and
 
ignoring
.
Positive
 
reinforcement
: 
This
 
occurs
 
when
 a 
behavior
 
is
 
followed
 
by
 a 
desired
 
outcome
 
or
 
reward
, 
thereby
 
increasing
 
the
 
likelihood
 
that
 
the
 
behavior
 
will
 be 
repeated
 
in
 
the
 
future
. 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee
 
receives
 
praise
 
from
 
his
 
supervisor
 
for
 a 
task
 
performed
 
effectively
, 
he
 
is
 
likely
 to 
continue
 to 
perform
 
well
.
Negative
 
reinforcement
: 
This
 
occurs
 
when
 
the
 
removal
 
of
 
an
 
unpleasant
 stimulus 
or
 
situation
 
reinforces
 a 
certain
 
behavior
. 
In
 
other
 
words
, 
when
 
an
 
individual
 
performs
 a 
certain
 
behavior
 to 
avoid
 
or
 
escape
 
from
 
an
 
undesirable
 
situation
, 
and
 
as
 a 
result
, 
that
 
negative
 
situation
 
is
 
reduced
 
or
 
eliminated
. 
For
 
example
, 
an
 
employee
 
may
 
work
 
harder
 to 
meet
 
deadlines
 to 
avoid
 
being
 
reprimanded
 
by
 a 
manager
.
Punishment
: 
The
 
use
 
of
 
negative
 
measures
 to 
reduce
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
unwanted
 
behavior
 
occurring
 
again
. 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee
 
is
 
consistently
 late 
for
 
work
, 
their
 
manager
 
may
 
decide
 to 
withhold
 
pay
 
or
 
assign
 
them
 to a 
less
 
desirable
 
project
.
Ignoring
: 
The
 
process
 
of
 
weakening
 
and
 
eventually
 
eliminating
 
an
 
unwanted
 
behavior
 
without
 
providing
 
any
 
reinforcement
 (
either
 
positive
 
or
 
negative
). 
For
 
example
, 
if
 
an
 
employee
 
often
 
gossips
 
about
 
co-workers
, 
and
 
their
 
co-workers
 
usually
 
respond
 
by
 
joining
 
in
 
the
 
conversation
, 
the
 
gossip
 
is
 
amplified
. To 
use
 
extinction
, 
colleagues
 
should
 stop 
responding
 to 
or
 
participating
 
in
 
gossip
. 
Over
 
time
, 
due
 to 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
reinforcement
, 
the
 
frequency
 
of
 
gossiping
 
should
 
decrease
.
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
motivation
 
and
 
management
, 
reinforcement
 
theory
 
can
 be 
applied
 
by
 
managers
 to 
shape
 
employee
 
behavior
 
by
 
implementing
 
appropriate
 
consequences
 (
reinforcements
 
or
 
punishments
) 
based
 
on
 
desired
 
outcomes
. 
By
 
understanding
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
reinforcement
, 
managers
 
can
 
encourage
 
positive
 
behaviors
 
and
 
discourage
 
negative
 
ones
, 
thereby
 
increasing
 
overall
 
employee
 
performance
 
and
 
satisfaction
.
---
Practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
application
:
Managers
 
should
 
positively
 
encourage
 
expected
 
behavior
 
as
 
often
 
as
 
possible
. 
Provide
 
the
 
incentive
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
possible
 
after
 
the
 
expected
 
behavior
 
has
 
occurred
. 
Do
 
positive
 
encouragement
 
regularly
. 
Ignore
 
unwanted
 
behavior
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
possible
. 
Avoid
 
punitive
 
methods
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
means
 
of
 
eliciting
 
desired
 
behavior
.
19
Equity
 
theory
 
is
 a 
theory
 
of
 
social
 
comparison
, 
which
 
in
 1963 
by
 
John
 
Stacey
 Adams. It 
focuses
 
on
 
how
 
individuals
 
perceive
 
the
 
fair
 
distribution
 
of
 
resources
 
and
 
rewards
 
in
 
the
 
workplace
, 
particularly
 
in
 
relation
 to 
their
 
own
 
efforts
 
and
 
those
 
of
 
others
. 
According
 to 
equity
 
theory
, 
people
 are 
motivated
 
by
 a 
desire
 to 
maintain
 a 
balance
 
between
 
what
 
they
 
perceive
 
as
 
their
 
own
 
contributions
 (
e.g
., 
hard
 
work
, 
skills
, 
experience
) 
and
 
outcomes
 (
e.g
., 
pay
, 
benefits
, 
recognition
) 
relative
 to 
the
 
contributions
 
and
 
outcomes
 
of
 
others
.
The
 
main
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
theory
 
of
 
equity
 are:
Contribution
 (
input
): 
An
 
individual's
 
contribution
 to a 
job
 
or
 
organization
, 
such
 
as
 
effort
, 
time
, 
skill
, 
experience
, 
education
, 
and
 
loyalty
.
Outcomes
 (
outputs
): 
These
 are 
the
 
rewards
 
or
 
benefits
 
that
 
an
 
individual
 
receives
 
for
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
input
, 
such
 
as
 
salary
, 
bonuses
, 
promotion
, 
recognition
, 
or
 
security
.
Comparison
: 
individuals
 
compare
 
their
 
contribution-outcome
 
ratio
 
with
 
their
 
peers
, 
acceptable
 
standards
 
in
 
the
 
labor
 
market
.
When
 
individuals
 
perceive
 
their
 
contribution-outcome
 
ratio
 to be 
equal
 to 
that
 
of
 
other
 
referents
, 
they
 
experience
 
justice
 
and
 are 
generally
 
satisfied
. 
However
, 
if
 
they
 
perceive
 
an
 
imbalance
 
or
 
inequity
, 
they
 
may
 
experience
 
resentment
, 
which
 
may
 
lead
 to a 
variety
 
of
 
retaliatory
 
actions
, 
such
 
as
:
Increase
 
or
 
decrease
 
your
 
contribution
 (eg, 
work
 
harder
 
or
 
relax
).
Adjust
 
perceptions
 
of
 
one's
 
own
 
or
 
others
' 
contributions
 
and
 
results
Comparing
 
yourself
 to 
other
 
referents
Seeking
 to 
change
 
your
 
performance
 (
e.g
. 
asking
 
for
 a 
raise
 
or
 
promotion
)
Leave
 
the
 
organization
Understanding
 
and
 
applying
 
equity
 
theory
 
can
 
help
 
create
 a 
fair
 
and
 
balanced
 
work
 
environment
, 
which
 
can
 
increase
 
employee
 
motivation
, 
satisfaction
, 
and
 
productivity
. 
This
 
includes
 
ensuring
 
that
 
rewards
 are 
distributed
 
fairly
, 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
each
 
employee's
 
relative
 
contribution
, 
and
 
transparency
 
in
 
decisions
 
about
 
pay
 
and
 
promotions
.
---
According
 to 
this
 
theory
, 
the
 
employee's
 
level
 
of
 
motivation
 
correlates
 
with
 
his
 
perceived
 
justice
, 
fairness
, 
and
 
equality
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
managers
. 
If
 
the
 
employee
 
perceives
 
that
 
he
 
is
 
treated
 
fairly
, 
then
 
his
 
motivation
 
level
 
is
 
higher
 
and
 vice versa. To 
assess
 
fairness
 
or
 
fairness
, 
an
 
employee
 
compares
 
himself
 
with
 
employees
 
of
 a 
similar
 
level
.
Practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
application
:
Managers
 
need
 to 
understand
 
that
 
employees
 are 
constantly
 
comparing
 
themselves
 to 
others
 
and
 
making
 
judgments
 
about
 
how
 
fairly
 
they
 are 
being
 
treated
. 
Employee
 
evaluation
 
can
 be 
quite
 
subjective
 
and
 
perceptions
 
may
 
not
 
correspond
 to 
reality
. 
Managers
 
should
 be 
transparent
 
about
 
employee
 
compensation
.

Expectations
 
theory
 
in
 1964. 
created
 
by
 
Victor
 
Vroom
. 
This
 
theory
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
cognitive
 
processes
 
that
 
individuals
 
experience
 
when
 
deciding
 
how
 to 
act
 
in
 a 
given
 
situation
. 
The
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
individuals
 are 
motivated
 to 
perform
 a 
task
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
they
 
expect
 
of
 
outcomes
 
and
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
those
 
outcomes
.
Expectancy
 
theory
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
following
 
key
 
elements
:
Expectancy
: 
Refers
 to a 
person's
 
belief
 
that
 
their
 
efforts
 
will
 
lead
 to a 
certain
 
level
 
of
 
performance
. 
In
 
other
 
words
, it 
is
 
the
 
realization
 
that
 
if
 
he
 
puts
 
in
 
the
 
necessary
 
effort
, 
he
 
will
 be 
able
 to 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
result
. 
High
 
expectations
 
mean
 
that
 
the
 
person
 
believes
 
that
 
their
 
hard
 
work
 
will
 
lead
 to 
success
, 
while
 
low
 
expectations
 
indicate
 
that
 
the
 
person
 
may
 
doubt
 
their
 
ability
 to 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
outcome
.
Requirement
: 
This
 
is
 
the
 
perceived
 
relationship
 
between
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
and
 
the
 
results
 
or
 
reward
 to be 
obtained
. 
Reflects
 
the
 
individual's
 
belief
 
that
 
if
 
he
 
performs
 
well
, 
he
 
will
 
receive
 a 
desired
 
reward
 (
such
 
as
 
recognition
, a 
promotion
, 
or
 a 
raise
). 
High
 
demands
 
mean
 
that
 
the
 
individual
 
believes
 
that
 
his
 
good
 
performance
 
will
 be 
adequately
 
rewarded
, 
while
 
low
 
demands
 
indicate
 
that
 
he
 
may
 
not
 
see
 a 
clear
 
connection
 
between
 
his
 
performance
 
and
 
the
 
reward
.
Relevance
: 
Refers
 to 
the
 
value
 
an
 
individual
 
places
 
on
 
the
 
outcomes
 
or
 
rewards
 
associated
 
with
 a 
task
. It 
shows
 
the
 
attractiveness
 
or
 
desirability
 
of
 
the
 
reward
 to 
the
 
individual
. A 
positive
 
congruence
 
indicates
 
that
 
the
 
individual
 
values
 
the
 
reward
 
and
 
finds
 it 
desirable
, 
while
 a 
negative
 
congruence
 
indicates
 
that
 
the
 
reward
 
is
 
undesirable
 
or
 
not
 
worth
 
pursuing
.
According
 to 
expectancy
 
theory
, 
an
 
individual's
 
motivation
 to 
perform
 a 
task
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
product
 
of
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
expectations
, 
requirements
, 
and
 
congruences
 (
i.e
., 
motivation
 = 
expectations
 × 
requirements
 × 
congruencies
). 
If
 
any
 
of
 
these
 
factors
 are 
low
 
or
 
zero
, 
the
 
individual's
 
overall
 
motivation
 
will
 be 
low
.
For
 
managers
, 
applying
 
expectancy
 
theory
 
can
 
help
 
them
 
develop
 
effective
 
motivational
 
strategies
 
that
 
focus
 
on
:
Strengthen
 
employees
' 
belief
 
that
 
their
 
efforts
 
will
 
lead
 to 
successful
 
results
 
through
 
appropriate
 
training
, 
resources
 
and
 
support
.
Ensure
 
that
 
there
 
is
 a 
clear
 link 
between
 
performance
 
and
 
reward
 
by
 
establishing
 
transparent
 
performance
 
criteria
 
and
 
fairly
 
rewarding
 
employees
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
achievements
.
Offer
 
rewards
 
that
 are 
valuable
 
and
 
desirable
, 
understanding
 
the
 
individual
 
needs
 
and
 
preferences
 
of
 
employees
.
---
The
 
theory
 
states
 
that
 
the
 
employee's
 
motivation
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
value
 ('
conformity
') 
of
 
the
 
reward
 
for
 
the
 
result
 ('
requirement
'), 
which
 
is
 
achieved
 
due
 to 
the
 
effort
 put 
in
 ('
expectation
').
Individual
 
perception
 
of
 
reality
 
is
 
very
 
important
 
in
 
this
 
theory
.
Practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
application
:
Employees
 
will
 
act
 
motivated
 
only
 
if
 
they
 
have
 a 
reasonable
 
expectation
 
that
 
their
 
behavior
 
will
 
lead
 to 
appropriate
 
results
 
and
 
rewards
. 
The
 
organization
 
must
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
reward
 
system
 
is
 
efficient
 
and
 
fair
, 
the
 
level
 
of
 
motivation
 
of
 
employees
 
must
 be 
constantly
 
monitored
 (
surveys
, 
personal
 
interviews
, etc.), it 
is
 
necessary
 to 
offer
 
sufficiently
 
interesting
, 
dynamic
, 
challenging
 
positions
 
so
 
that
 
employees
 
can
 
try
 
their
 
hand
 
and
 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
results
.

Motivation
 
methods
 
can
 be 
divided
 
into
 
three
 
main
 
types
: socio-
psychological
, 
organizational
 (
administrative
) 
and
 
economic
, 
which
 
include
 
both
 
financial
 
and
 
non-financial
. 
These
 
methods
 
aim
 to 
encourage
 
and
 
inspire
 
employees
 to 
work
 
as
 best 
as
 
possible
 
and
 
contribute
 to 
the
 
achievement
 
of
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
.
1. 
Sociopsychological
 
methods
 
of
 
motivation
:
Sociopsychological
 
methods
 
focus
 
on
 
psychological
 
and
 
social
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
environment
. 
These
 
methods
 
aim
 to 
promote

ensure
 
that
 
everyone
 
understands
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
 
and
 
expectations
.

 to 
participate
 
in
 
decision-making
 
processes
 
and
 
allowing
 
them
 to 
contribute
 
their
 
own
 
ideas
 
can
 
increase
 
their
 
sense
 
of
 
ownership
 
and
 
commitment
 to 
the
 
organization
.
Team
 
building
 
and
 
strengthening
. 
Organizing
 
team-building
 
events
 
and
 
social
 
gatherings
 
can
 
help
 
improve
 
interpersonal
 
relationships
 
and
 
create
 a 
sense
 
of
 
belonging
 
among
 
employees
.
2.

create
 a 
conducive
 
and
 
efficient
 
work
 
environment
.

and
 
abilities
 
can
 
increase
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
motivation
.

help
 
identify
 
areas
 
for

and
 
provide
 
opportunities
 
for
 
employee
 
growth
 
and
 
development
.
Training
 
and
 
development
: 
Offering
 
continuous
 
learning
 
opportunities
 
and
 
professional
 
development
 
can
 
increase
 
employee
 
competence
 
and
 
motivation
.
3. 
Economic
 
methods
 
of
 
motivation
:
Economic
 
methods
 
can
 be 
further
 
divided
 
into
 
financial
 
and
 
non-financial
. Financial 
methods
 
include
 
monetary
 
rewards
 
and
 
incentives
, 
while
 
non-financial
 
methods
 
focus
 
on
 
non-monetary
 
benefits
 
and
 
perks

a) Financial 
methods

Compensation
 
and
 
benefits
: 
Competitive
 
and
 
fair
 
compensation
 
can
 
attract
 
and
 
retain
 
employees

 be a 
key
 
motivator
 
for
 
their
 
performance
.
Bonuses
 
and
 
commissions
: 
Offering
 
performance-based
 
rewards
 
can
 
motivate
 
employees
 to 
achieve
 
specific
 
goals
 
or
 
improve
 
their
 
work
.
Profit
 
sharing
 
and
 
stock
 
options
: 
Allowing
 
employees
 to 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
organization
 
can
 
create
 a 
sense
 
of
 
ownership
 
and
 
loyalty
.
b
) 
Non-financial
 
methods

Flexible
 
work
 
arrangements

flexible
 
working
 
hours
, 
telecommuting
 
or
 
job
 
sharing
 
options

work-life
 
balance
 
and
 
employee
 
satisfaction
.
Career
 
development
 
opportunities

Providing
 
clear
 
career
 
paths
 
and
 
promotion
 
opportunities

their
 
skills
 
and
 
improve
 
performance
.
Employee
 
benefits
: 
Offering
 
benefits
 
such
 
as
 
health
 
insurance
, 
retirement
 
plans
, 
or
 
paid
 
time
 
off
 
can
 
contribute
 to 
overall
 
employee
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
motivation
.
Some
 
examples
 
of
 
non-financial
 
methods
 
can
 also be 
considered
 socio-
psychological
 
methods
. 
The
 
categorization
 
of
 
motivation
 
methods
 
can
 
sometimes
 
overlap
, 
as
 
certain
 
methods
 
can
 be 
aimed
 at 
both
 
psychological
 
and
 
economic
 
motivation
 
of
 
employees
. 
The
 
main
 
goal
 
is
 to 
create
 a 
comprehensive
 
approach
 
that
 
meets
 
the
 
diverse
 
needs
 
and
 
preferences
 
of
 
employees
.
By
 
using
 a 
combination
 
of
 
different
 
motivational
 
methods
 
and
 
tools
, 
organizations
 
can
 
effectively
 
increase
 
employee
 
motivation
, 
job
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
overall
 
productivity
.

Rekomenduojama laikytis šių etapų:
Išsiaiškinti, kas veikia darbuotojus vienaip ar kitaip elgtis
Išsiaiškinti darbuotojų poreikius
Suskirstyti darbuotojus pagal poreikius į grupes
Įvertinti darbuotojo darbą
Sukurti motyvacijos modelį 
1. Problemos identifikavimas, 
t.y
. iškeliama problema – ar apskritai yra vieningos motyvavimo sistemos poreikis organizacijoje ar ne;
2. Priklausomai nuo atsakymo į pirmojo etapo klausimą, formuluojami sekantys veiksmai. Jei tyrimas parodo, kad motyvavimo sistemos, darbuotojų nuomone, nereikia, tuomet tyrimas baigtas. Jei paaiškėja, kad motyvavimo sistema yra reikalinga, tuomet sekantys etapai šie:
2.1. Atliekamas motyvacijos ir motyvavimo tyrimas organizacijoje. Motyvacinės situacijos analizei taikomi du pagrindiniai metodai (
Bivainis
 2011):
- Organizacijos vidaus dokumentų analizė;
- Darbuotojų apklausa;
Apklausos metu išsiaiškinti darbuotojų nuomonę įvairiais motyvacijos aspektais (
