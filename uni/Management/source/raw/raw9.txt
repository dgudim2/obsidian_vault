The manager can divide employees as follows:
15% work very well
20% work well and moderately
30% work moderately
20% work moderately and poorly
15% work very poorly
Behaviourally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS)
Management by Objective (MBO) 
Personal Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
360-degree feedback
Cost Accounting Method
This method evaluates an employee's performance based on the employee's contribution in monetary terms. Here, the evaluator assesses the employee based on the costs of retaining them and the benefits the organization derives from their contribution. 
When using this method, the following factors are taken into account:
Eployee training costs
Quality of services provided or products produced
Accidents, defects, errors, breakdowns, waste, etc.
Time spent evaluating the employee
Assessment centers
This method is mainly used to assess the potential of top-level managers
Employees are taken to a location far from work, subjected to a series of tests and exercises, such as being asked to participate in a variety of activities; simulations, group exercises and role-plays, etc.
Each of these tests assesses the employee's behavior and provides feedback based on strengths and weaknesses

Discussion
Employee performance appraisal is an essential aspect of organizational management that helps assess employee productivity, identify areas for improvement, and align individual performance with organizational goals. Various evaluation methods are used in order to fully understand the performance of employees.
A compensation system is an essential component in maintaining employee satisfaction and motivation. It includes various forms of compensation. A well-designed compensation system should aim to fairly and consistently reward employees based on their value to the organization, motivate them to achieve organizational goals, and retain top talent.
The selection of employee evaluation methods and the development of reward systems depends on factors such as organizational goals, employee perspective, market conditions, and costs.

Performance management
The
 360° 
appraisal
 
method
, also 
known
 
as
 
the
 360-degree 
questionnaire
, 
is
 a 
comprehensive
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
methodology
 
that
 
collects
 
feedback
 
on
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
. 
These
 
sources
 
typically
 
include
 
the
 
employee's
 
supervisor
, 
peers
, 
subordinates
, 
and
 
sometimes
 
customers
. 
In
 
some
 
cases
, 
the
 
employee
 also 
submits
 a 
self-evaluation
. 
This
 
approach
 
aims
 to 
provide
 a 
comprehensive
 
picture
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
, 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
multiple
 
perspectives
 
and
 
minimizing
 
potential
 
bias
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Evaluators
 are 
selected
: 
The
 
first
 
step
 
is
 to 
determine
 
who
 
will
 
provide
 
feedback
 
on
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
. 
This
 
usually
 
includes
 
the
 
employee's
 
manager
, 
peers
, 
subordinates
, 
and
 
may
 also 
include
 
external
 
stakeholders
 
such
 
as
 
customers
. 
Involving
 a 
diverse
 
group
 
of
 
raters
 
helps
 to 
ensure
 
that
 
feedback
 
is
 
balanced
 
and
 
reflects
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
in
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
their
 
job
.
Selected
 
evaluation
 
criteria
: A 
set
 
of
 
performance
 
criteria
 
or
 
competences
 
is
 
determined
 
that
 
corresponds
 to 
the
 
employee's
 
job
 role 
and
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
. 
These
 
criteria
 
may
 
include
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
communication
, 
teamwork
, 
leadership
, 
problem
 
solving
 
and
 
technical
 
skills
. It 
is
 
essential
 to 
use
 
clear
, 
objective
 
criteria
 to 
facilitate
 
accurate
 
and
 
consistent
 
evaluator
 
evaluations
.
Collected
 
feedback
: 
Each
 
evaluator
 
is
 
given
 a 
standardized
 
evaluation
 
form
 
or
 
questionnaire
 
asking
 
them
 to rate 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
criteria
. 
Assessors
 
should
 be 
encouraged
 to 
provide
 
specific
 
examples
 
and
 
constructive
 
feedback
 to 
support
 
their
 
assessments
. 
In
 
order
 to 
encourage
 
honest
 
and
 
open
 
feedback
, it 
is
 
often
 
useful
 to 
keep
 
the
 
identity
 
of
 
reviewers
 
anonymous
.
Analyzed
 
results
: 
After
 
collecting
 
feedback
, 
the
 
results
 are 
analyzed
 to 
identify
 
strengths
, 
weaknesses
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
. 
This
 
process
 
often
 
involves
 
summarizing
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
evaluators
' 
ratings
 
and
 
comments
 
and
 
presenting
 
the
 
findings
 
in
 a 
summary
 
report
.
Feedback
 
is
 
provided
: 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 360° 
assessment
 are 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
employee
 
during
 a 
performance
 
appraisal
 
meeting
. 
The
 
discussion
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
key
 
findings
, 
including
 
the
 
employee's
 
strengths
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
any
 
discrepancies
 
between
 
self-assessment
 
and
 
feedback
 
received
 
from
 
others
. It 
is
 
very
 
important
 to 
emphasize
 
the
 
developmental
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
feedback
 
and
 
discuss
 
possible
 
action
 
plans
 
or
 
goals
 to 
address
 
identified
 
areas
 
of
 
growth
.
Monitored
 
progress
: 
After
 a 360° 
assessment
, it 
is
 
necessary
 to 
regularly
 
monitor
 
the
 
employee
 to 
determine
 
his
 
progress
 
in
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
. 
This
 
ongoing
 
support
 
may
 
include
 
providing
 
additional
 
resources
, 
training
, 
or
 
coaching
 to 
help
 
the
 
employee
 
develop
 
skills
 
and
 
improve
 
performance
.
Advantages
 
of
 
the
 360° 
assessment
 
method
:
Comprehensive
 
Feedback
: 
This
 
method
 
collects
 
feedback
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
, 
providing
 a 
more
 
comprehensive
 
picture
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
and
 
potential
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
.
Reduces
 
bias
: 
By
 
involving
 a 
variety
 
of
 
raters
, 
the
 360° 
appraisal
 
method
 
minimizes
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
personal
 
bias
, 
favoritism
, 
or
 
leniency
 
that
 
may
 
influence
 
ratings
.
Promotes
 
self-awareness
 
and
 
development
: 
Receiving
 
feedback
 
from
 
multiple
 
perspectives
 
can
 
help
 
employees
 
gain
 a 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
their
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
, 
foster
 a 
growth
 
mindset
 
and
 
continuous
 
improvement
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
the
 360° 
evaluation
 
method
:
Time-
consuming
: 
Collecting
, 
analyzing
, 
and
 
discussing
 
feedback
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
 
can
 be 
labor-intensive
 
and
 
time-consuming
 
for
 
both
 
employees
 
and
 
evaluators
.
Potential
 
for
 
resentment
 
or
 
conflict
: 
Some
 
employees
 
may
 
find
 it 
difficult
 to 
accept
 
negative
 
feedback
 
from
 
colleagues
 
or
 
subordinates
, 
which
 
can
 
lead
 to 
resentment
 
or
 
conflict
.
Reliability
 
and
 
validity
 
concerns
: 
The
 
quality
 
of
 
feedback
 
can
 vary 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
knowledge
, 
understanding
 
and
 
biases
 
of
 
raters
, 
which
 
can
 
affect
 
the
 
reliability
 
and
 
validity
 
of
 
assessment
 
results
.

The
 
employee
 
benefit
 
method
 
is
 a 
performance
 
evaluation
 
method
 
that
 
focuses
 
on
 
the
 
financial
 
impact
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
actions
 
and
 
decisions
 
on
 
the
 
organization
. 
This
 
includes
 
quantifying
 
an
 
employee's
 
contributions
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
cost
 
savings
, 
revenue
 
generation
, 
or
 
other
 
financial
 
metrics
 
related
 to 
their
 
job
 role 
and
 
responsibilities
.
The
 
main
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
method
 
is
 to 
determine
 
how
 
much
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
contributes
 to 
the
 
organization's
 
financial
 
success
, 
allowing
 
managers
 to 
make
 
informed
 
decisions
 
about
 
promotion
, 
compensation
, 
and
 
resource
 
allocation
. 
This
 
method
 
is
 
particularly
 
useful
 
for
 
evaluating
 
employees
 
who
 
perform
 
duties
 
directly
 
related
 to 
the
 
company's
 
financial
 
operations
, 
such
 
as
 sales 
or
 
finance
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Financial 
indicators
 are 
defined
: 
relevant
 
financial
 
indicators
 are 
determined
 to 
evaluate
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
revenue
 
generated
, 
cost
 
savings
, 
costs
 
incurred
 
or
 
return
 
on
 
investment
 (ROI) 
for
 
specific
 
projects
 
or
 
initiatives
. 
The
 
selected
 
indicators
 
must
 be 
compatible
 
with
 
the
 
employee's
 
job
 
duties
 
and
 
the
 
organization's
 
strategic
 
goals
.
The
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
results
 are 
set
: 
the
 
values
 
of
 
the
 
selected
 
indicators
 are 
clearly
 
defined
Monitored
 
results
: 
during
 
the
 
entire
 
evaluation
 
period
, 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
is
 
monitored
 
according
 to 
the
 
set
 
goals
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
tracking
 
relevant
 
financial
 data, 
such
 
as
 sales 
figures
, 
cost
 
savings
 
or
 
expenses
, 
and
 
analyzing
 
the
 
employee's
 
impact
 
on
 
these
 
numbers
.
Performance
 
results
 are 
evaluated
: at 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
period
, 
the
 
actual
 
work
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
employee
 are 
compared
 
with
 
the
 
set
 
goals
. It 
determines
 
whether
 
they
 
met
, 
exceeded
, 
or
 
fell
 
short
 
of
 
expectations
 
for
 
each
 
financial
 
indicator
.
Feedback
 
is
 
provided
: 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
assessment
 are 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
employee
, 
discussing
 
their
 
performance
 
in
 
relation
 to 
financial
 
indicators
 
and
 
goals
. 
This
 
discussion
 
should
 
include
 
any
 
areas
 
of
 
strength
 
or
 
improvement
, 
as
 
well
 
as
 
suggestions
 
for
 
how
 
the
 
employee
 
can
 
increase
 
their
 
financial
 
contribution
 to 
the
 
organization
.
Adjustment
 
of
 
goals
 
and
 
strategies
: 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
assessment
, 
performance
 
goals
 
or
 
strategies
 are 
adjusted
 
as
 
necessary
 to 
better
 
align
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
financial
 
goals
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
setting
 
more
 
ambitious
 
goals
, 
providing
 
additional
 
resources
 
or
 
support
, 
or
 
revising
 
the
 
employee's
 
job
 
duties
.
While
 
this
 
approach
 
can
 
provide
 
valuable
 
insights
 
into
 
an
 
employee's
 
financial
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
organization
, 
it's
 
important
 to 
consider
 
other
 
aspects
 
of
 
their
 
performance
, 
such
 
as
 
teamwork
, 
communication
 
and
 
problem
 
solving
. 
Combining
 
the
 
employee
 
benefits
 
approach
 
with
 
other
 
evaluation
 
methods
 
can
 
help
 
create
 a 
more
 
comprehensive
 
and
 
balanced
 
assessment
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
overall
 
performance
.

potential
, 
often
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
selection
, 
promotion
 
or
 
development
.
Assessment
 
centers
 
typically
 
include
 a 
series
 
of
 
exercises
, 
simulations
, 
and
 
activities
 
designed
 to 
replicate
 
real-world
 
work
 
situations

evaluated
 
by
 
trained
 
raters
 
who
 
assess
 
their
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
behavioral

An
 
annual
 
interview
, also 
called
 
an
 
annual
 
performance
 
review
 
or
 
annual
 
appraisal
, 
is
 a 
formal
 
process
 
in
 
which
 
an
 
employee
 
and
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
supervisor
 
discuss
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
, 
achievements
, 
goals
, 
and
 
development
 
plans
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
year
. 
This
 
meeting
 
provides
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
both
 
sides
 to 
reflect
 
on
 
the
 
employee's
 
contribution
 to 
the
 
organization
, 
identify
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
set
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
coming
 
year
. 
The
 
annual
 
interview
 
is
 a 
critical
 
component
 
of
 
performance
 
management
 
systems
 
and
 
plays
 a 
critical
 role 
in
 
driving
 
employee
 
growth
 
and
 
engagement
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Preparation
: 
Both
 
the
 
employee
 
and
 
their
 
supervisor
 
should
 
prepare
 
for
 
the
 
annual
 
meeting
 
by
 
reviewing
 
relevant
 
documents
 
such
 
as
 
job
 
descriptions
, 
performance
 
objectives
, 
and
 
any
 
previous
 
evaluations
 
or
 
feedback
. 
The
 
employee
 
may
 be 
asked
 to 
complete
 a 
self-assessment
, 
and
 
the
 
manager
 
should
 
gather
 
information
 
from
 
other
 
relevant
 parties, 
such
 
as
 
colleagues
 
or
 
subordinates
.
Agenda
: 
The
 
manager
 
should
 
prepare
 
an
 
agenda
 
for
 
the
 
annual
 
meeting
 
that
 
covers
 
topics
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
employee's
 
achievements
, 
challenges
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
coming
 
year
, 
and
 
any
 
training
 
or
 
development
 
needs
. 
This
 
agenda
 
should
 be 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
employee
 
in
 
advance
 to 
prepare
 
for
 
the
 
discussion
.
Conducting
 
the
 
interview
: 
During
 
the
 
annual
 
interview
, 
the
 
manager
 
and
 
the
 
employee
 
should
 
have
 a 
constructive
, 
open
 
and
 
honest
 
discussion
 
about
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
. 
The
 
conversation
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
employee's
 
accomplishments
 
and
 
contributions
 to 
the
 
organization
, 
as
 
well
 
as
 
any
 
areas
 
where
 
they
 
may
 
need
 to 
improve
 
or
 
improve
 
their
 
skills
. 
Both
 parties 
should
 
actively
 
listen
 
and
 
provide
 
feedback
, 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
conversation
 
is
 
balanced
 
and
 
collaborative
.
Goal
 
setting
: 
The
 
annual
 
interview
 
should
 
discuss
 
the
 
employee's
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
coming
 
year
, 
which
 
should
 be 
specific
, 
measurable
, 
achievable
, 
relevant
 
and
 
time-bound
 (SMART). 
These
 
goals
 
should
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
strategic
 
goals
 
and
 
the
 
employee's
 
duties
 
and
 
responsibilities
. Manager 
and
 
employee
 
should
 
agree
 
on
 
these
 
goals
 
and
 
document
 
them
 
for
 
future
 
reference
.
Development
 
Planning
: 
The
 
annual
 
interview
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 to 
identify
 
any
 
training
 
or
 
development
 
needs
 
the
 
employee
 
may
 
have
, 
such
 
as
 
attending
 
seminars
, 
obtaining
 
certifications
 
or
 
participating
 
in
 
mentoring
 
programs
. 
The
 
manager
 
and
 
the
 
employee
 
should
 
develop
 a 
plan
 to 
meet
 
these
 
needs
 
and
 
support
 
the
 
employee's
 
growth
 
and
 
professional
 
development
.
Documentation
: 
The
 
manager
 
should
 
document
 
key
 
points
 
discussed
 at 
the
 
annual
 
meeting
, 
including
 
the
 
employee's
 
achievements
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
coming
 
year
, 
and
 
any
 
development
 
plans
. 
These
 
documents
 serve 
as
 a 
record
 
of
 
the
 
meeting
 
and
 
can
 be 
used
 
throughout
 
the
 
year
 to 
monitor
 
progress
 
and
 
guide
 
ongoing
 
performance
 
management
.
Follow-up
: 
After
 
the
 
annual
 
interview
, 
the
 
manager
 
should
 
monitor
 
the
 
employee's
 
progress
 
toward
 
their
 
goals
 
and
 
provide
 
ongoing
 
feedback
, 
coaching
, 
and
 
support
 to 
help
 
them
 
succeed
. A 
regular
 
review
 
and
 
discussion
 
of
 
performance
 
throughout
 
the
 
year
 
can
 
help
 
maintain
 
momentum
 
and
 
ensure
 
that
 
an
 
employee
 
is
 
not
 
falling
 
short
 
of
 
their
 
goals
.
By
 
conducting
 
well-designed
 
and
 
constructive
 
annual
 
interviews
, 
organizations
 
can
 
promote
 
employee
 
engagement
, 
motivation
 
and
 
professional
 
growth
.
21
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
employee
 
evaluation
 
and
 
appraisal
, 
there
 are 
several
 
potential
 
challenges
 
that
 
can
 
affect
 
the
 
impartiality
 
of
 
the
 
appraisal
 
process
.
Halo 
effect
: 
The
 
halo
 
effect
 
occurs
 
when
 
an
 
evaluator's
 
overall
 
impression
 
of
 
an
 
employee
 
is
 
overly
 
influenced
 
by
 
one
 
positive
 
trait
, 
causing
 
them
 to 
overlook
 
other
, 
potentially
 
negative
, 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
. 
For
 
example
, a 
particularly
 
punctual
 
employee
 
may
 be 
perceived
 
as
 
highly
 
competent
 
in
 
all
 
areas
, 
even
 
if
 
his
 
actual
 
performance
 
in
 
other
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
job
 
is
 
insufficient
.
Leniency
: 
This
 
is
 a 
bias
 
where
 
evaluators
 
avoid
 
giving
 
honest
 
evaluations
 to 
avoid
 
conflict
 
or
 to 
maintain
 a 
harmonious
 
relationship
 
with
 
the
 
employee
 
being
 
evaluated
. 
This
 
can
 
lead
 to 
inflated
 
performance
 
appraisals
 
and
 a 
lack
 
of
 
constructive
 
feedback
, 
ultimately
 
hindering
 
employee
 
growth
 
and
 
development
.
Narrow
 
focus
 
on
 
recent
 
events
: 
when
 
evaluating
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
, it 
is
 
necessary
 to take 
into
 
account
 
his
 
performance
 
over
 
the
 
entire
 
evaluation
 
period
. 
However
, 
raters
 
may
 
inadvertently
 
focus
 
on
 
recent
 
events
, 
both
 
positive
 
and
 
negative
, 
resulting
 
in
 
an
 
unbalanced
 
assessment
 
that
 
does
 
not
 
accurately
 
reflect
 
the
 
employee's
 
overall
 
performance
.
"
Like
 Me" 
or
 
Similarity
 
Bias
: 
This
 
bias
 
occurs
 
when
 
raters
 
favor
 
employees
 
who
 
share
 
similar
 
values
, 
interests
, 
or
 
backgrounds
. 
As
 a 
result
, 
these
 
employees
 
may
 
receive
 
higher
 
performance
 
ratings
, 
while
 
those
 
who
 are 
different
 
may
 be 
underrated
, 
regardless
 
of
 
their
 
actual
 
performance
.
In
 
order
 to 
ensure
 a 
fair
 
and
 
accurate
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
process
, it 
is
 
important
 
that
 
appraisers
 are 
aware
 
of
 
these
 
biases
 
and
 take 
measures
 to 
mitigate
 
their
 
effects
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
standardized
 
assessment
 
tools
, 
gathering
 
information
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
, 
focusing
 
on
 
objective
 
performance
 
criteria
, 
and
 
ongoing
 
training
 
and
 
development
 to 
improve
 
raters
' 
skills
 
and
 
awareness
 
of
 
potential
 
bias
. 
By
 
addressing
 
these
 
biases
, 
organizations
 
can
 
create
 a 
fairer
 
and
 
more
 
effective
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
process
 
that
 
supports
 
employee
 
growth
 
and
 
development
.
22
Reward
 
is
 a 
form
 
of
 
compensation
, 
recognition
 
and
 
encouragement
 
given
 to 
an
 
employee
 
for
 
his
 
work
, 
efforts
 
or
 
achievements
 
in
 
the
 
organization
. 
Rewards
, 
which
 
can
 be 
monetary
 
or
 
non-monetary
, are 
intended
 to 
motivate
 
and
 
engage
 
employees
 
by
 
reinforcing
 
behavior
 to 
achieve
 
results
 
that
 are 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
 
and
 
values
. 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
employee
 
performance
, 
rewards
 are 
economic
 
exchanges
 
in
 
which
 
employees
 
receive
 
something
 
of
 
value
 
for
 
their
 
contributions
 to 
the
 
organization
. 
The
 
concept
 
of
 
remuneration
 
is
 
central
 to 
the
 
employment
 
relationship
 
because
 it 
emphasizes
 
the
 
economic
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
relationship
. 
In
 
other
 
words
, 
employees
 
engage
 
in
 
work-related
 
physical
 
and
 
mental
 
activities
 
that
 
benefit
 
the
 
employer
 
and
 are 
rewarded
 
for
 
doing
 
so
.
24
Reward
 
can
 take 
two
 
forms
, 
extrinsic
 
and
 
intrinsic
, 
which
 serve 
different
 
purposes
 
and
 are 
determined
 
by
 
different
 
factors
.
Extrinsic
 
reward
 
is
 a 
tangible
 
form
 
of
 
reward
 
given
 to 
employees
 
for
 
their
 
performance
, 
achievements
 
or
 
behavior
. 
This
 
may
 
include
:
monetary
 
compensation
 
such
 
as
 
raises
, 
bonuses
 
or
 
commissions
promotion
 
or
 
career
 
opportunities
non-cash
 
benefits
 
such
 
as
 
vacation
 
days
, 
health
 
insurance
 
or
 
retirement
 
plans
formal
 
recognition
 
such
 
as
 
awards
, 
certificates
 
or
 
public
 
recognition
 
of
 
achievements
Extrinsic
 
reward
 
is
 
closely
 
related
 to 
extrinsic
 
motivation
, 
which
 
arises
 
from
 
external
 
factors
.
Intrinsic
 
rewards
, 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand
, are 
intangible
, 
resulting
 
from
 
an
 
individual's
 
own
 
sense
 
of
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
or
 
accomplishment
. 
Such
 
form
 
of
 
remuneration
 
may
 
include
:
personal
 
satisfaction
 
from
 
completing
 
difficult
 
tasks
 
or
 
solving
 
complex
 
problems
pride
 
in
 
one's
 
work
 
or
 a 
sense
 
of
 
accomplishment
 
from
 
reaching
 a 
goal
the
 
pleasure
 
that
 
comes
 
from
 
learning
 a 
new
 
skill
 
or
 
mastering
 a 
particular
 
subject
 
area
a 
sense
 
of
 
purpose
 
or
 
meaning
 
in
 
work
, 
such
 
as
 
contributing
 to a 
greater
 
purpose
 
or
 
helping
 
others
Intrinsic
 
reward
 
refers
 to 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 
that
 
originates
 
with
 
the
 
individual
 
and
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
personal
 
interests
, 
values
, 
or
 a 
sense
 
of
 
purpose
. 
Employees
 
with
 
high
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 are 
more
 
engaged
 
in
 
their
 
work
 
and
 
experience
 
satisfaction
 
from
 
the
 
work
 
itself
 
rather
 
than
 
focusing
 
solely
 
on
 
extrinsic
 
rewards
 
or
 
results
.
Both
 
extrinsic
 
and
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
 are 
important
, 
and
 
organizations
 
should
 
strive
 to 
create
 
an
 
environment
 
that
 
supports
 
and
 
encourages
 
both
 
types
 
of
 
motivation
. A 
balance
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
is
 
necessary
, 
as
 
relying
 
solely
 
on
 
extrinsic
 
rewards
 
can
 
undermine
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
, 
which
 
reduces
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
engagement
. 
Conversely
, 
relying
 
solely
 
on
 
intrinsic
 
rewards
 
may
 
not
 
provide
 
employees
 
with
 
the
 
financial
 
security
 
or
 
tangible
 
benefits
 
they
 
need
, 
which
 
may
 also 
have
 a 
negative
 
impact
 
on
 
motivation
 
and
 
performance
.
Ideally
, 
organizations
 
should
 
offer
 a mix 
of
 
extrinsic
 
and
 
intrinsic
 
rewards
 
that
 
meet
 
the
 
diverse
 
needs
 
and
 
motivations
 
of
 
employees
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
providing
 
competitive
 
compensation
 
packages
, 
career
 
development
 
opportunities
 
and
 a 
supportive
 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
promotes
 
personal
 
growth
, 
autonomy
 
and
 a 
sense
 
of
 
purpose
. 
By
 
promoting
 
both
 
extrinsic
 
and
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
, 
organizations
 
can
 
promote
 
employee
 
engagement
, 
satisfaction
, 
and
 
overall
 
performance
.
25
A 
compensation
 
system
 
is
 a 
comprehensive
 
system
 
designed
 
by
 
an
 
organization
 to 
determine
 
and
 
distribute
 
various
 
forms
 
of
 
rewards
, 
such
 
as
 
salaries
, 
bonuses
, 
and
 
benefits
, to 
its
 
employees
 
in
 
exchange
 
for
 
their
 
work
, 
efforts
, 
and
 
achievements
. 
The
 
primary
 
objective
 
of
 a 
compensation
 
system
 
is
 to 
attract
, 
retain
 
and
 
motivate
 
employees
 
by
 
ensuring
 
that
 
they
 are 
fairly
 
compensated
 
for
 
their
 
contribution
 to 
the
 
organization
.
26
The
 
reward
 
for
 
work
 
system
 
aims
 at 
the
 
following
 
goals
:
Fair
, 
impartial
 
and
 
consistent
 
compensation
 A 
well-designed
 
system
 
should
 
recognize
 
and
 
reward
 
employees
 
according
 to 
the
 
value
 
they
 
bring
 to 
the
 
organization
. 
This
 
includes
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
job
 
title
, 
skills
, 
education
, 
experience
 
and
 
market
 
competitiveness
 to 
ensure
 
fair
 
and
 
equitable
 
pay
 
across
 
the
 
organization
.
Motivate
 
employees
 to 
achieve
 
organizational
 
goals
 
By
 
linking
 
rewards
 to 
performance
 
indicators
 
and
 
organizational
 
goals
, a 
reward
 
system
 
can
 
motivate
 
employees
 to 
achieve
 
organizational
 
goals
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
offering
 
performance-based
 
incentives
, 
such
 
as
 
bonuses
 
or
 
profit-sharing
 
plans
, to 
encourage
 
employees
 to 
perform
 
their
 
duties
 
well
.
Increase
 
employee
 
productivity
 A 
reward
 
system
 
can
 
encourage
 
employees
 to 
work
 
more
 
efficiently
, 
thus
 
increasing
 
their
 
productivity
. 
By
 
offering
 
rewards
 
for
 
exceptional
 
performance
 
or
 
productivity
 
improvements
, 
organizations
 
can
 
foster
 a 
results-oriented
 
work
 
culture
.
Retaining
 
Good
 
Employees
 
Competitive
 
and
 
fair
 
pay
 
is
 
critical
 to 
retaining
 
the
 best 
talent
 
in
 
an
 
organization
. 
By
 
offering
 
attractive
 
compensation
 
packages
 
that
 
reflect
 
the
 
value
 
and
 
contribution
 
of
 
employees
, 
organizations
 
can
 
encourage
 
long-term
 
commitment
 
and
 
reduce
 
the
 risk 
of
 
losing
 
valuable
 
employees
 to 
competitors
.
Reduce
 
employee
 
turnover
 
High
 
employee
 
turnover
 
can
 be 
costly
 to 
an
 
organization
, 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
recruitment
 
and
 
training
 
costs
 
and
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
knowledge
 
loss
. 
By
 
offering
 a 
comprehensive
 
and
 
fair
 
compensation
 
system
, 
organizations
 
can
 
improve
 
employee
 
satisfaction
, 
loyalty
 
and
 
engagement
, 
ultimately
 
reducing
 
employee
 
turnover
 
rates
.
By
 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
goals
, 
organizations
 
can
 
create
 a 
supportive
 
work
 
environment
 
that
 
promotes
 
employee
 
engagement
, 
satisfaction
, 
and
 
overall
 
success
.
27
When
 
designing
 a 
reward
 
system
, 
an
 
organization
 
must
 
consider
 
various
 
factors
 
that
 
may
 
influence
 
their
 
decisions
.
The
 
employer's
 
perspective
The
 
goals
 
and
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
organization
 
play
 a 
decisive
 role 
in
 
shaping
 
the
 
reward
 
system
. 
The
 
system
 
should
 
correspond
 to 
the
 
company's
 
strategic
 
priorities
 
and
 
help
 
implement
 
its
 
mission
 
and
 
vision
. 
Factors
 to 
consider
 
from
 
an
 
employer's

for
 
employees
, 
ensuring
 
they
 
feel
 
valued
, 
engaged
 
and
 
motivated

Market 
Perspective
 
The
 
labor
 
market
 
in
 
which
 
an
 
organization
 
competes
 
can
 
significantly
 
affect
 
its
 
reward

perspective
It 
is
 
necessary
 to 
balance
 
the
 
need
 
for
 a 
competitive
 
reward
 
system
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
financial
 
constraints
 
and
 
budget
. 
When
 
designing
 a 
reward
 
system
, 
management
 
should
 
consider
:
Total
 
labor
 
costs
 
and
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
organization's
 
financial
 
condition
The

, 
an
 
organization
 
can
 
create
 a 
comprehensive
 
and
 
balanced

that
 
supports
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
, 
meets

, 
meets
 
market
 
conditions
, 
and
 
does
 
not
 
exceed
 
acceptable
 
cost
 
levels

A 
compensation
 
structure
 
defines
 
the
 
various
 
components
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
compensation
 
package
, 
including
 
financial
 
and
 
non-financial
 
rewards
. 
This
 
structure
 
aims
 to 
create
 a 
competitive
 
and
 
attractive
 
compensation
 
package
 
that
 
motivates
 
employees
, 
promotes
 
engagement
 
and
 
contributes
 to 
the
 
overall
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
organization
. 
The
 
reward
 
structure
 
can
 be 
divided
 
into
 
two
 
main
 
categories
: 
financial
 
reward
 
and
 
non-financial
 
reward
.
Financial 
reward
Financial 
compensation
 
includes
 
the
 
monetary
 
aspects
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
compensation
 
package
. It 
can
 be 
further
 
divided
 
into
 
three
 
main
 
components
:
Base 
Salary
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
fixed
 
regular
 
salary
 
that
 
an
 
employee
 
receives
 
for
 
his
 
or
 
her
 
position
, 
usually
 
determined
 
by
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
position
, 
skills
, 
education
, 
experience
, 
and
 
market
 
competitiveness
. Base 
pay
 
can
 be 
paid
 
hourly
, 
weekly
 
or
 
monthly
 
and
 
is
 
the
 
basis
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
compensation
 
package
.
Variable
 
part
 
of
 
salary
 
This
 
is
 
performance-based
 
salary
 
linked
 to 
individual
 
or
 
organizational
 
performance
 
indicators
. 
Bonuses
, 
commissions
, 
or
 
profit-sharing
 
plans
 
that
 
aim
 to 
encourage
 
and
 
reward
 
employees
 
for
 
exceptional
 
performance
 
or
 
achievement
 
of
 
specific
 
goals
 
may
 also 
belong
 to 
this
 
part
.
Employee
 
Benefits
 
In
 
addition
 to 
direct
 
cash
 
compensation
, 
employees
 
may
 also 
receive
 a 
variety
 
of
 
other
 
benefits
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
total
 
compensation
 
package
. 
These
 
benefits
 
may
 
include
 
health
 
insurance
, 
retirement
 
plans
, 
paid
 
time
 
off
, 
tuition
 
reimbursement
, 
or
 
other
 
benefits
 
that
 
add
 to 
the
 
employee's
 
overall
 
compensation
 
package
.
Non-financial
 
reward
These
 are 
the
 
intangible
 
aspects
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
compensation
 
package
 
that
 
contribute
 to 
their
 
job
 
satisfaction
, 
engagement
 
and
 
motivation
. 
This
 
may
 
include
:
Recognition
, 
achievement
 
and
 
growth
 
Opportunities
 
for
 
personal
 
and
 
professional
 
development
, 
such
 
as
 
training
 
programs
, 
career
 
advancement
 
or
 
skills
 
development
 
initiatives
, 
can
 be 
highly
 
motivating
 
for
 
employees
. 
Recognizing
 
and
 
celebrating
 
employees
' 
achievements
 
can
 also 
contribute
 to 
their
 
sense
 
of
 
achievement
 
and
 
pride
 
in
 
their
 
work
.
Job
 
design
 (
the
 
job
 
itself
) 
The
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
job
, 
including
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
challenge
, 
variety
, 
and
 
autonomy
, 
can
 
greatly
 
affect
 
employee
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
motivation
. 
Well-designed
 
work
 
can
 
give
 
employees
 a 
sense
 
of
 
purpose
, 
meaning
 
and
 
intrinsic
 
motivation
, 
leading
 to 
increased
 
engagement
 
and
 
productivity
.
Work
 
Environment
 
The
 
physical
 
and
 
social
 
work
 
environment
, 
including
 
workplace
 
culture
, 
relationships
 
with
 
colleagues
 
and
 
supervisors
, 
and
 
the
 
general
 
atmosphere
, 
can
 also 
influence
 
employee
 
motivation
 
and
 
satisfaction
. A 
positive
, 
supportive
 
and
 
inclusive
 
work
 
environment
 
can
 
foster
 
employee
 
engagement
, 
collaboration
 
and
 
well-being
.
A 
comprehensive
 
compensation
 
structure
 
should
 
include
 
both
 
financial
 
and
 
non-financial
 
rewards
 to 
create
 a 
competitive
 
and
 
attractive
 
compensation
 
package
. 
By
 
considering
 
both
 
aspects
, 
organizations
 are 
better
 
able
 to 
attract
, 
retain
, 
and
 
motivate
 
employees
, 
which
 
ultimately
 
contributes
 to 
the
 
overall
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
organization
.
29
Key
 
personal
 
performance
 
indicators
 (
KPIs
) are 
evaluation
 
measures
 
used
 to 
evaluate
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
in
 
relation
 to 
specific
 
organizational
 
goals
. 
When
 
used
 
in
 
conjunction
 
with
 
techniques
 
such
 
as
 
management
 
by
 
objectives
 (MBO), 
shared
 
goal
 
setting
 
and
 
key
 
performance
 
areas
 (
KRAs
), 
personal
 
KPIs
 
can
 be 
very
 
clear
, 
providing
 a 
basis
 
for
 
objective
 
evaluation
 
of
 
employees
. 
They
 vary 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
specifics
 
of
 
the
 
organization's
 
activities
, 
the
 
level
 
of
 
work
 
performed
 
and
 
the
 
person's

A 
payroll
 
system
 
is
 a 
comprehensive
 
and
 
organized
 
process
 
used
 
by
 
organizations
 to 
manage
 
and
 
administer
 
employee
 
compensation
. 
This
 
includes
 
calculating
 
and
 
disbursing
 
wages
, 
bonuses
, 
commissions
 
and
 
other
 
forms
 
of
 
financial
 
compensation
 to 
employees
. 
The
 
payroll
 
system
 also 
handles
 
deductions
 
for
 
taxes
, 
social
 
security
 
and
 
other
 
benefits
, 
ensuring
 
compliance
 
with
 
legal
 
and
 
regulatory
 
requirements
.
A 
well-functioning
 
payroll
 
system
 
is
 
critical
 to 
paying
 
employees
 
accurately
 
and
 
on
 
time
, 
maintaining
 
employee
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
trust
, 
and
 
meeting
 
legal
 
obligations
. 
The
 
main
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
payroll
 
system
 are:
Employee
 
Information
 
The
 
payroll
 
system
 
must
 
contain
 
accurate
 
and
 
up
-to-
date
 
employee
 
records
, 
including
 
personal
 
details
, 
employment
 status, 
job
 
title
, 
salary
 
structure
 
and
 
tax
 
return
 status. 
This
 
information
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
accurate
 
calculations
 
and
 
record
 
keeping
.
Time 
and
 
Attendance
 
Tracking
 
Payroll
 
systems
 
often
 
include
 
time
 
and
 
attendance
 
tracking
 
features
 to 
track
 
employee
 
hours
, 
overtime
, 
and
 
paid
 
vacation
 
time
. 
When
 
calculating
 
wages
, 
especially
 
for
 
hourly
 
workers
, it 
is
 
very
 
important
 to 
accurately
 
calculate
 
the
 
time
 
worked
.
Salary
 
Calculation
 A 
payroll
 
system
 
should
 
accurately
 
calculate
 
each
 
employee's
 
earnings
, 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 base 
salary
, 
hourly
 
pay
, 
overtime
 
pay
, 
bonuses
, 
commissions
, 
and
 
other
 
forms
 
of
 
compensation
. 
The
 
system
 
must
 also 
handle
 
various
 
deductions
 
such
 
as
 
income
 
tax
, 
social
 
security
 
contributions
 
and
 
employee
 
benefits
.
Tax
 
and
 
Legal
 
Compliance
 
Payroll
 
systems
 
must
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
relevant
 
tax
 
laws
 
and
 
regulations
. 
The
 
system
 
should
 also 
generate
 
the
 
necessary
 
tax
 
forms
 
and
 
reports
 to be 
submitted
 to 
the
 
relevant
 
authorities
.
Payment
 
Processing
 
Once
 
the
 
calculations
 are 
complete
, 
the
 
payroll
 
system
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
processing
 
payments
 to 
employees
, 
usually
 
through
 
direct
 
deposit
, 
paper
 
checks
, 
or
 
other
 
payment
 
methods
. 
The
 
system
 
should
 also 
generate
 
payslips
 
detailing
 
each
 
employee's
 
income
 
and
 
deductions
.
Reporting
 
and
 
record
 
keeping
 A 
payroll
 
system
 
should
 
maintain
 
comprehensive
 
records
 
of
 
all
 
payroll
 
transactions
 
and
 
generate
 
reports
 
for
 
internal
 
and
 
external
 
audit
 
purposes
. 
These
 
records
 
help
 
organizations
 
track
 
payroll
 
costs
, 
maintain
 
financial
 
accuracy
, 
and
 
comply
 
with
 
legal
 
record-keeping
 
requirements
.
Payroll
 
systems
 
can
 be 
managed
 
through
 
software
 
or
 
outsourced
 to 
third-party
 
payroll
 
service
 
providers
. 
In
 
recent
 
years
, 
many
 
organizations
 
have
 
adopted
 
cloud-based
 
payroll
 
solutions
 
that
 
offer
 
greater
 
flexibility
, 
scalability
, 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
use
. 
Regardless
 
of
 
the
 
specific
 
system
 
chosen
, a 
reliable
 
and
 
efficient
 
payroll
 
process
 
is
 
essential
 to 
maintaining
 
employee
 
satisfaction
, 
trust
 
and
 
compliance
.

Wage
 
progression
 
refers
 to 
the
 
process
 
by
 
which
 
an
 
individual
 
employee
 
reaches
 a 
higher
 
wage
 
level
 
within
 a 
given
 
wage
 range. 
Pay
 
grades
, 
or
 
bands
, are 
established
 
salary
 
ranges
 
associated
 
with
 
specific
 
job
 roles 
or
 
responsibilities
, 
often
 
reflecting
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
responsibility
, 
skill
, 
and
 
experience
 
required
. 
Salary
 
progression
 
within
 
these
 
ranges
 
allows
 
employees
 to be 
rewarded
 
for
 
their
 
growth
, 
experience
 
and
 
contributions
 to 
the
 
organization
 
over
 
time
.
There
 are 
several
 
factors
 
that
 
can
 
affect
 
salary
 
progression
, 
including
:
Productivity
 
Employee
 
performance
 
can
 be 
an
 
important
 
factor
 
in
 
determining
 
salary
 
progression
. 
Organizations
 
often
 
use
 
performance
 
appraisals
 
or
 
evaluations
 to 
measure
 
an
 
employee's
 
work
, 
achievements
, 
and
 
contributions
 to 
the
 
company
. 
High-performing
 
employees
 
may
 
receive
 
pay
 
increases
 to 
recognize
 
their
 
efforts
 
and
 
encourage
 
continued
 
excellence
.
Tenure
 
The
 
length
 
of
 
time
 
an
 
employee
 
has
 
been
 
with
 
the
 
organization
 
can
 also 
affect
 
salary
 
progression
. 
As
 
employees
 
gain
 
experience
 
and
 a 
deeper
 
understanding
 
of
 
their
 roles, 
their
 
value
 to 
the
 
company
 
can
 
increase
, 
justifying
 
higher
 
pay
 
within
 
their
 
assigned
 
pay
 
grade
 
or
 range.
Skill
 
development
 
Employees
 
who
 
acquire
 
new
 
skills
, 
certifications
 
or
 
qualifications
 
related
 to 
their
 roles 
may
 be 
eligible
 
for
 
remuneration
. 
By
 
investing
 
in
 
their
 
professional
 
development
, 
employees
 
can
 
demonstrate
 
their
 
commitment
 to 
growth
 
and
 
adding
 
value
 to 
the
 
organization
, 
which
 
justifies
 
higher
 
rewards
.
Market 
Competitiveness
 
When
 
determining
 
wage
 
increases
, 
organizations
 
must
 
consider
 
market
 
conditions
 
and
 
the
 
compensation
 
practices
 
of
 
competitors
. 
In
 
order
 to 
attract
 
and
 
retain
 
top
 
talent
, 
companies
 
may
 
need
 to 
adjust
 
pay
 
rates
 
within
 
their
 
pay
 
grades
 
or
 
bands
 to 
remain
 
competitive
 
in
 
their
 
industry
.
Internal
 
Equity
 
Ensuring
 
fair
 
and
 
consistent
 
pay
 
progression
 
throughout
 
the
 
organization
 
is
 
essential
 to 
maintaining
 
employee
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
trust
. 
Companies

Using
 
this
 
method
, 
the
 
manager
 
must
 
formulate
 
specific
, 
measurable
 
goals
 
for
 
each
 
employee
 
and
 
periodically
 
discuss
 
with
 
him
 
how
 
well
 
these
 
goals
 are 
being
 
achieved
.
The
 
application
 
of
 
this
 
method
 
is
 
generally
 
understood
 
as
 
an
 
organization-wide
 6-part 
goal
 
formulation
 
and
 
evaluation
 
program
:
1. 
Organizational
 
goals
 are 
formulated
: 
annual
, 
prospective
. 
This
 
is
 
an
 
essential
 
element
 
of
 
strategic
 
planning
.
2. 
The
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
units
 are 
formulated
 
and
 
discussed
. 4. 
Very
 
specific
 
short-term
 
and
 
forward-looking
 
work
 
results
 are 
foreseen
 
for
 
each
 
employee
. 5. 
The
 
performance
 
results
 
of
 
each
 
employee
 are 
evaluated
 
and
 
compared
 
with
 
the
 
planned
 
ones
. 6. 
Feedback
 
is
 
ensured
.
Advantages
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
It 
is
 
more
 
objective
 
because
 it 
is
 
based
 
on
 
clear
 
criteria
 
and
 
indicators
 to 
measure
 
them
.
Causes
 
less
 
conflict
, 
because
 
in
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process
, 
both
 
the
 
evaluator
 
and
 
the
 
evaluator
 
see
 
what
 
has
 
or
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
achieved
 
based
 
on
 a 
review
 
of
 
objective
 
indicators
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
this
 
method
:
Problematic
 
setting
 
of
 
results
 (
goals
), 
criteria
, 
for
 
example
: 
is
 it 
possible
 
for
 a 
surgeon
 to 
formulate
 a 
goal
 to 
perform
 25 
percent
 
more
 
operations
 per 
year
, 
for
 a 
police
 
officer
 to 
solve
 
more
 
than
 20 
percent
 
of
 
murders
, 
for
 a 
university
 
teacher
 to 
write
 
more
 
than
 50 
percent
 
of
 
grades
 "
excellent
" 
in
 
the
 
study
 
books
, 
or
 vice versa - 
more
 
than
 50 
percent
 "
unsatisfactory
". 
Hence
, 
quantitative
 
criteria
 are 
not
 
suitable
 
in
 
all
 
cases
, 
but
 
qualitative
 
ones
 
should
 be 
sought
. 
For
 
example
, 
for
 a 
university
 
as
 
an
 
organization
, 
these
 
would
 be 
the
 
following
 
criteria
: 
how
 
many
 
people
 
studied
, 
obtained
 diplomas 
and
 
how
 
many
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
employed
 
according
 to 
the
 
acquired
 
specialty
, 
and
 
most
 
importantly
, 
how
 
many
 
study
 
programs
 
meet
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
labor
 
market
.

Behaviorally
 
Based
 
Rating
 
Scales
 (BARS) are 
an
 
employee
 
evaluation
 
method
 
that
 
assesses
 
performance
 
based
 
on
 
specific
, 
observable
 
behaviors
 
directly
 
related
 to 
job
 
success
. BARS 
combines
 
aspects
 
of
 
traditional
 
rating
 
scales
 
with
 
detailed
 
behavioral
 
samples
, 
allowing
 
for
 
more
 
objective
 
and
 
accurate
 
assessments
. 
This
 
method
 
is
 
particularly
 
useful
 
for
 
assessing
 
work-related
 
competencies
, 
skills
, 
or
 
behaviors
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Criteria
 
Selection
: 
The
 
first
 
step
 
is
 to 
identify
 
the
 
performance
 
criteria
 
or
 
characteristics
 to be 
assessed
, 
such
 
as
 
job-specific
 
skills
, 
competencies
, 
or
 
behaviors
. 
These
 
criteria
 
should
 be 
job-related
 
and
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
.
Behavioral
 
Identification
: 
Subject
 
matter
 
experts
, 
including
 
incumbents
, 
managers
, 
or
 HR 
professionals
, 
collaborate
 to 
identify
 
specific
, 
observable
 
behaviors
 
that
 
reflect
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
achievement
 
for
 
each
 
criterion
. 
This
 
behavior
 
is
 
called
 "
anchors
".
Scale
 
development
: A 
rating
 
scale
 
is
 
created
 
for
 
each
 
criterion
, 
usually
 
ranging
 
from
 5 to 7 
points
. 
Each
 
point
 
on
 
the
 
scale
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 a 
specific
 
pattern
 
of
 
behavior
 
that
 
represents
 a 
specific
 
level
 
of
 
performance
, 
from
 
poor
 to 
excellent
 
or
 a 
similar
 
progression
. 
The
 
scale
 
should
 be 
designed
 
so
 
that
 
levels
 
of
 
performance
 are 
clearly
 
defined
 
and
 
easily
 
distinguished
.
Employee
 
evaluation
: 
Managers
 
evaluate
 
employee
 
performance
 
by
 
assigning
 a 
rating
 to 
each
 
criterion
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
employee's
 
behavior
 
during
 
the
 
evaluation
 
period
. 
The
 
rating
 
should
 
reflect
 
the
 
manager's
 
opinion
 
of
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
relative
 to 
predetermined
 
behavioral
 
anchors
 
on
 
the
 
scale
.
Feedback
 
and
 
discussion
: 
After
 
completing
 
the
 
appraisal
, 
managers
 
provide
 
feedback
 to 
the
 
employee
 
through
 a 
performance
 
appraisal
 
meeting
. 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 to 
discuss
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
future
 
goals
. 
Using
 
specific
 
examples
 
of
 
behavior
 
as
 
reference
 
points
 
makes
 
feedback
 
more
 
objective
, 
constructive
 
and
 
effective
.
Documentation
 
and
 
follow-up
: 
Completed
 BARS 
assessments
 
should
 be 
documented
 
and
 
retained
 
for
 
future
 
reference
. 
This
 
documentation
 
can
 be 
used
 to 
track
 
employee
 
progress
, 
inform
 
management
 
decisions
, 
and
 
provide
 a 
basis
 
for
 
future
 
evaluations
.
Advantages
 
of
 
Behaviorally
 
Based
 
Rating
 
Scales
 (BARS):
Objectivity
: BARS 
focuses
 
on
 
specific
, 
observable
 
behavior
, 
reduces
 
subjectivity
, 
and
 
promotes
 
consistency
 
in
 
assessments
.
Clear
 
performance
 
expectations
: 
The
 
approach
 
gives
 
employees
 
clear
 
expectations
 
of
 
what
 
constitutes
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
performance
, 
making
 it 
easier
 
for
 
them
 to 
understand
 
how
 to 
improve
.
Effective
 
Feedback
: 
Linking
 BARS 
ratings
 to 
specific
 
behaviors
 
facilitates
 
more
 
meaningful
 
and
 
effective
 
feedback
 
during
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
discussions
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
Behaviorally
 
Based
 
Rating
 
Scales
 (BARS):
Time-
consuming
: 
Developing
 BARS 
can
 be 
labor-intensive
, 
requiring
 
extensive
 
analysis
 
of
 
job
 
requirements
 
and
 
collaboration
 
with
 
subject
 
matter
 
experts
 to 
identify
 
appropriate
 
behavioral
 
anchors
.
Limited
 
flexibility
: BARS 
focuses
 
on
 
predetermined
 
behaviors
 
that
 
may
 
not
 
cover
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
or
 
adapt
 to 
changes
 
in
 
job
 
requirements
 
over
 
time
.
Potential
 
bias
: 
Although
 
the
 BARS 
reduces
 
subjectivity
, it 
is
 
not
 
immune
 to 
bias
 
because
 
managers
 
may
 
still
 
interpret
 
and
 
apply
 
behavioral
 
anchors
 
differently
.
Let's
 
say
 
you
 are a 
customer
 
service
 
manager
 
and
 
you
 
want
 to 
assess
 
the
 
communication
 
skills
 
of
 
your
 
employees
 
using
 
the
 
Behavioral
 
Anchored
 
Rating
 
Scale
 (BARS) 
method
. 
The
 
method
 
could
 
then
 be 
applied
 
as
 
follows
:
As
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
on
 
communication
 
skills
, 
the
 
selected
 
assessment
 
criterion
 
is
 '
Effective
 
Communication
'.
Collaborating
 
with
 
other
 
supervisors
 
and
 
experienced
 
customer
 
service
 
representatives
 
establishes
 
specific
, 
observable
 
behaviors
 
that
 
reflect
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
effective
 
communication
.
A 5-point 
rating
 
scale
 
is
 
created
 
for
 
the
 "
Effective
 
communication
" 
criterion
. 
Each
 
point
 
will
 be 
associated
 
with
 a 
specific
 
pattern
 
of
 
behavior
 
that
 
represents
 a 
certain
 
level
 
of
 
activity

The
 
forced
 
allocation
 
method
, also 
known
 
as
 
forced
 
ranking
 
or
 
viability
 
curve
, 
is
 
an
 
employee
 
evaluation
 
method
 
that
 
requires
 
managers
 to rate 
and
 
rank
 
employees
 
into
 
predetermined
 
performance
 
categories
 
such
 
as
 
top
, 
average
, 
and
 
poor
 
performers
. 
The
 
approach
 
is
 
usually
 
based
 
on
 a 
curve
 
distribution
 
where
 
most
 
workers
 are 
classified
 
as
 
average
 
performers
 
and
 
smaller
 
percentages
 
as
 
top
 
performers
 
and
 
poor
 
performers
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Selecting
 
Criteria
 
The
 
first
 
step
 
is
 to 
identify
 
the
 
performance
 
criteria
 
or
 
attributes
 
that
 
will
 be 
used
 
for
 
evaluation
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
job-related
 
skills
, 
competencies
, 
behaviors
 
or
 
other
 
performance-related
 
factors
. It 
is
 
necessary
 to 
choose
 
appropriate
 
and
 
objective
 
criteria
 
that
 
accurately
 
reflect
 
the
 
job
 
requirements
 
and
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
.
Category
 
definition
 
The
 
organization
 
must
 
define
 
the
 
activity
 
categories
 
and
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
employees
 to be 
assigned
 to 
each
 
category
. A 
normal
 
distribution
 
might
 
consist
 
of
 10-20% 
top
 
performers
, 70-80% 
average
 
performers
, 
and
 10-20% 
poor
 
performers
. 
Specific
 
percentages
 
may
 vary 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
 
and
 
performance
 
management
 
philosophy
.
Employee
 
evaluation
 
Managers
 
evaluate
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
their
 
employees
 
according
 to 
predetermined
 
criteria
 
and
 
assign
 
each
 
employee
 to 
one
 
of
 
the
 
performance
 
categories
. 
This
 
process
 
often
 
involves
 
ranking
 
employees
 
within
 a 
team
 
or
 
department
 
and
 
then
 
adding
 
the
 
rankings
 to a 
predetermined
 
distribution
.
Feedback
 
and
 
Discussion
 
Managers
 
provide
 
feedback
 to 
employees
 
through
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
meetings
, 
discussing
 
their
 
performance
 
category
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
future
 
goals
. It 
is
 
essential
 to 
provide
 
specific
 
examples
 
and
 
evidence
 to 
support
 
the
 
categorization
, 
ensuring
 
that
 
feedback
 
is
 
constructive
 
and
 
objective
.
Documentation
 
and
 
follow-up
 
Completed
 
forced
 
allocation
 
assessments
 
must
 be 
documented
 
and
 
retained
 
for
 
future
 
reference
. 
This
 
documentation
 
can
 be 
used
 to 
track
 
employee
 
progress
, 
inform
 
management
 
decisions
, 
and
 
provide
 a 
basis
 
for
 
future
 
evaluations
.
Advantages
 
of
 
the
 
forced
 
distribution
 
method
:
Differentiation
: 
This
 
method
 
makes
 a 
clear
 
distinction
 
between
 
high
, 
average
 
and
 
poor
 
performers
, 
which
 
can
 
help
 
identify
 
top
 
talent
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
may
 
need
 
additional
 
support
 
or
 
development
.
Reduces
 
bias
: 
By
 
requiring
 
managers
 to 
assign
 
employees
 to 
predetermined
 
performance
 
groups
, 
this
 
method
 
can
 
reduce
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
personal
 
bias
 
and
 
leniency
 
that
 
can
 
affect
 
other
 
appraisal
 
methods
.
Promotes
 
Accountability
: 
Forced
 
allocation
 
can
 
encourage
 
managers
 to be 
more
 
deliberate
 
and
 
objective
 
in
 
their
 
evaluations
, 
as
 
they
 
have
 to 
justify
 
their
 
decisions
 
when
 
assigning
 
employees
 to 
different
 
performance
 
categories
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
the
 
forced
 
distribution
 
method
:
Demotivating
: 
This
 
approach
 
can
 
create
 
competition
 
among
 
employees
, 
which
 
can
 
lead
 to a 
negative
 
work
 
environment
, 
reduced
 
cooperation
, 
and
 
decreased
 morale.
Arbitrary
 
ranking
: 
Some
 
employees
 
may
 be 
unfairly
 
ranked
 
as
 
poor
 
performers
 
simply
 
because
 
they
 are 
in
 a 
highly
 
skilled
 
or
 
high-performing
 
team
, 
while
 
others
 
may
 be 
ranked
 
higher
 
in
 a 
less
 
competitive
 
team
, 
which
 
may
 
lead
 to 
unfairness
.
Ignores
 
individual
 
performance
: 
The
 
forced
 
allocation
 
method
 
is
 
designed
 to 
compare
 
employees
 
with
 
each
 
other
 
rather
 
than
 to 
measure
 
individual
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
standards
 
or
 
goals
.

Example
 
in
 
the
 slide:
Using
 
the
 
paired
 
comparison
 
method
, 
each
 
evaluated
 
subordinate
 
is
 
paired
 
and
 
compared
 
according
 to 
each
 
criterion
 
with
 
another
 
subordinate
. 
For
 
example
, 
the
 
following
 
performance
 
criteria
 
can
 be 
chosen
: 
quality
 – 
accuracy
, 
completeness
 
and
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
work
 (
activity
) 
performed
; 
productivity
 - 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
work
 
done
 
in
 a 
certain
 
time
 
and
 
the
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
results
 (
in
 
terms
 
of
 
quality
). 
According
 to 
each
 
selected
 
criterion
, 
all
 
possible
 pairs 
of
 
employees
 are 
listed
. 
Next
, 
the
 
manager
 
marks
 
which
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
employees
 
is
 
better
 
for
 
each
 
criterion
 
by
 
writing
 
plus
 
or
 minus. 
Later
, 
the
 
number
 
of
 
times
 
the
 
employee
 
was
 
recognized
 
as
 
better
 
according
 to 
any
 
criterion
 
is
 
added
 up.

The
 
paired
 
comparison
 
method
 
is
 a 
method
 
in
 
which
 
employees
 are 
evaluated
 
and
 
ranked
 
by
 
directly
 
comparing
 
them
 
according
 to 
specific
 
performance
 
criteria
. 
This
 
method
 
involves
 
comparing
 
each
 
employee
 to 
every
 
other
 
employee
 
in
 a 
group
 
or
 
team
 to 
determine
 
their
 
relative
 
performance
. 
The
 
main
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
pairwise
 
comparison
 
method
 
is
 to 
rank
 
employees
 to 
help
 
identify
 
top
 
performers
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
may
 
need
 
improvement
 
or
 
additional
 
support
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Selection
 
of
 
criteria
 
The
 
first
 
step
 
is
 to 
determine
 
the
 
criteria
 
that
 
will
 be 
used
 
for
 
comparison
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
job-related
 
skills
, 
competencies
, 
behaviors
 
or
 
other
 
performance-related
 
factors
. It 
is
 
necessary
 to 
choose
 
appropriate
 
and
 
objective
 
criteria
 
that
 
accurately
 
reflect
 
the
 
job
 
requirements
 
and
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
.
Employee
 
comparison
 
Each
 
employee
 
is
 
compared
 to 
every
 
other
 
employee
 
in
 
the
 
group
 
or
 
team
 
according
 to 
each
 
criterion
. 
Managers
 
evaluate
 
which
 
employee
 
performs
 
better
 
on
 a 
specific
 
evaluated
 
criterion
. 
The
 
result
 
of
 
this
 
process
 
is
 a 
series
 
of
 
comparisons
 
that
 
help
 
determine
 
the
 
relative
 
performance
 
of
 
each
 
employee
.
Scoring
 
and
 
Ranking
 
Each
 
time
 
an
 
employee
 
is
 
judged
 to be 
better
 
than
 
another
 
employee
 
in
 
the
 
comparison
, 
they
 
receive
 a 
point
. 
After
 
all
 
possible
 
comparisons
 are 
made
, 
the
 
points
 are 
tallied
 
and
 
the
 
employees
 are 
ranked
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
total
 
scores
. 
Employees
 
with
 
the
 
highest
 
scores
 are 
considered
 
top
 
performers
, 
while
 
employees
 
with
 
lower
 
scores
 
may
 
need
 
additional
 
support
 
or
 
development
.
Feedback
 
and
 
discussion
 
Rating
 
results
 
can
 be 
used
 to 
provide
 
feedback
 to 
employees
 
during
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
meetings
. 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 to 
discuss
 
employees
' 
activities
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
 
and
 
future
 
goals
. It 
is
 
essential
 to 
provide
 
specific
 
examples
 
and
 
evidence
 to 
support
 
the
 
ranking
, 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
feedback
 
is
 
constructive
 
and
 
objective
.
Documentation
 
and
 
follow-up
 
Completed
 
pairwise
 
comparison
 
ratings
 
should
 be 
documented
 
and
 
stored
 
for
 
future
 
reference
. 
This
 
documentation
 
can
 be 
used
 to 
track
 
employee
 
progress
, 
inform
 
management
 
decisions
, 
and
 
provide
 a 
basis
 
for
 
future
 
evaluations
.
Advantages
 
of
 
the
 
paired
 
comparison
 
method
:
Simplified
 
decision-making
: 
By
 
comparing
 
employees
 
directly
, 
managers
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
specific
 
characteristics
 
and
 
make
 
decisions
 
about
 
which
 
employee
 
better
 
meets
 
each
 
criteria
.
Reduces
 
bias
: 
Because
 
employees
 are 
compared
 
based
 
on
 
specific
 
criteria
, 
this
 
method
 
can
 
reduce
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
personal
 
bias
 
and
 
subjective
 
judgments
 
that
 
can
 
affect
 
other
 
evaluation
 
methods
.
Clear
 
ranking
: 
The
 
pairwise
 
comparison
 
method
 
creates
 a 
clear
 
ranking
 
of
 
employees
, 
making
 it 
easy
 to 
identify
 
top
 
performers
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
may
 
need
 
additional
 
support
 
or
 
development
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
the
 
paired
 
comparison
 
method
:
Time-
consuming
: 
This
 
method
 
can
 be 
time-consuming
, 
especially
 
in
 
large
 
groups
, 
as
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
comparisons
 
increases
 
significantly
 
with
 
each
 
additional
 
employee
.
Limited
 
feedback
: 
The
 
paired-comparison
 
approach
 
focuses
 
on
 
creating
 a 
rating
, 
so
 
employees
 
may
 
not
 
provide
 
enough
 
qualitative
 
feedback
 to 
understand
 
the
 
reasons
 
for
 
their
 
ratings
 
or
 
identify
 
specific
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
.
May
 
not
 be 
limited
 to 
individual
 
performance
: 
Because
 
the
 
approach
 
focuses
 
on
 
comparing
 
employees
, it 
may
 
effectively
 
underestimate
 
individual
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
standards
 
or
 
goals
.
12
Graphical
 
rating
 
scales
 are a 
widely
 
used
 
employee
 
evaluation
 
method
 
that
 
involves
 
evaluating
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
against
 a 
set
 
of
 
predetermined
 
criteria
 
or
 
characteristics
. 
In
 
this
 
approach
, 
each
 
attribute
 
is
 
represented
 
on
 a 
scale
, 
usually
 
ranging
 
from
 
poor
 to 
excellent
 
or
 
similar
, 
allowing
 
managers
 to rate 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
along
 a 
continuum
.
Application
 
of
 
the
 
method
:
Selection
 
of
 
criteria
 
The
 
first
 
step
 
is
 to 
identify
 
the
 
criteria
 
or
 
attributes
 
that
 
will
 be 
evaluated
. 
This
 
may
 
include
 
job-related
 
skills
, 
competencies
, 
behaviors
 
or
 
other
 
performance-related
 
factors
. It 
is
 
necessary
 to 
choose
 
appropriate
 
and
 
objective
 
criteria
 
that
 
accurately
 
reflect
 
the
 
job
 
requirements
 
and
 
meet
 
the
 
organization's
 
goals
.
Creating
 a 
scale
 A 
scale
 
is
 
created
 
for
 
each
 
criterion
, 
which
 
usually
 
consists
 
of
 5-7 
points
. 
Each
 
point
 
on
 
the
 
scale
 
represents
 a 
certain
 
level
, 
from
 
poor
 to 
excellent
 
or
 
similar
 
progression
. 
The
 
scale
 
should
 be 
designed
 
so
 
that
 
levels
 
of
 
activity
 are 
clearly
 
defined
 
and
 
easily
 
distinguishable
.
Employee
 
evaluation
 
Managers
 
evaluate
 
employee
 
performance
 
by
 
assigning
 a 
rating
 to 
each
 
criterion
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
during
 
the
 
evaluation
 
period
. 
The
 
rating
 
should
 
reflect
 
the
 
manager's
 
opinion
 
of
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
relative
 to 
predetermined
 
scale
 
levels
.
Feedback
 
and
 
Discussion
 
After
 
completing
 
the
 
appraisal
, 
managers
 
provide
 
feedback
 to 
the
 
employee
 
during
 a 
performance
 
appraisal
 
meeting
. 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 to 
discuss
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
, 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
future
 
goals
. 
Providing
 
specific
 
examples
 
and
 
evidence
 to 
support
 
ratings
 
is
 
essential
, 
as
 
this
 
helps
 
ensure
 
feedback
 
is
 
constructive
 
and
 
objective
.
Documentation
 
and
 
follow-up
 
Completed

Advantages
 
of
 
graphic
 
rating
 
scales
:
Simple
 
and
 
easy
 to 
understand
: 
The
 
method
 
is
 
straightforward
, 
making
 it 
easy
 
for
 
managers
 to 
implement
 
and
 
for
 
employees
 to 
understand
.
Comparable
: 
Graphical
 
rating
 
scales
 
provide
 a 
numerical
 
rating
 
for
 
each
 
criterion
, 
making
 it 
easy
 to 
compare
 
and
 
analyze
 
performance
 data.
Standardization
: 
The
 
use
 
of
 
predetermined
 
criteria
 
and
 
scales
 
promotes
 
consistency
 
and
 
objectivity
 
in
 
the
 
assessment
 
process
.
Disadvantages
 
of
 
graphic
 
rating
 
scales
:
Subjectivity
: 
The
 
method
 
relies
 
on
 
the
 
manager's
 
judgment
, 
which
 
may
 be 
influenced
 
by
 
personal
 
biases
 
or
 
perceptions
, 
which
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
inconsistent
 
or
 
incorrect
 
estimates
.
Limited
 
feedback
: 
Graphical
 
rating
 
scales
 
primarily
 
focus
 
on
 
assigning
 a 
numerical
 
rating
, 
which

but
 
there
 
is
 a 
noticeable
 
disadvantage
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
commission
 
may
 be 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
work
 
of
 
the
 
evaluator
.
3. 
Co-workers
, 
colleagues
. 
By
 
involving
 
peers
 
in
 
evaluation
, 
an
 
organization
 
can
 
increase
 
competitiveness
 
among
 
employees
. 
Colleagues
 
and
 
colleagues
 
can
 
evaluate
 
the
 
appraised
 
as
 
professionals
 
in
 a 
certain
 
field
, 
unfortunately
, 
the
 
evaluation
 
results
 
can
 be 
determined
 
by
 
jealousy
, 
likes
 
or
 
dislikes
.
4. 
Subordinates
. 
If
 
an
 
organization
 
uses
 a 
method
 
in
 
which
 
managers
 are 
evaluated
 
by
 
subordinates
, it 
shows
 
that
 
the
 
organization
 
is
 
democratic
. 
In
 
this
 
way
, 
the
 
manager
 
himself
 
can
 
learn
 
about
 
his
 
management
 
and
 
communication
, 
and
 
this
 
information
 
is
 also 
important
 
for
 
the
 
top
 
manager
. A 
noticeable
 
problem
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
manager's
 
performance
 
is
 
evaluated
 
much
 
better
 
if
 
anonymity
 
is
 
not
 
ensured
 
during
 
the
 
evaluation
.
5. 
Personnel
 
department
 
specialists
. 
They
 
understand
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
evaluation
, 
the
 
processes
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
system
, 
but
 
the
 
problem
 
is
 
that
 
they
 
may
 
not
 
know
 
everything
 
about
 
the
 
activities
 
of
 
the
 
evaluator
.
6. 
Independent
 
experts
. 
External
 
experts
 
better
 
notice
 
the
 
personal
 
and
 
business
 
characteristics
 
of
 
the
 
evaluators
, 
but
 
they
 
cannot
 
accurately
 
assess
 
the
 
employee's
 
performance
 
due
 to 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
knowledge
 
about
 
the
 
specifics
 
of
 
the
 
organization
. 
In
 
addition
, 
hiring
 
external
 
experts
 
requires
 
additional
 
financial
 
resources
.
7. 
Self-evaluation
. 
Most
 
often
, 
the
 
employee's
 
self-evaluation
 
is
 
combined
 
with
 
the
 
manager's
 
evaluation
. 
The
 
main
 
disadvantage
 
of
 
this
 
assessment
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
person
 
being
 
assessed
 
usually
 
assesses
 
himself
 
much
 
better
 
than
 
he
 
actually
 
is
. 
Although
 
the
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
manager
 
and
 
the
 
employee
 
often
 
do
 
not
 
match
, 
research
 
shows
 
that
 
self-evaluation
 
increases
 
the
 
readiness
 
of
 
employees
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation
 
interview
, 
strengthens
 
the
 
overall
 
satisfaction
, 
provides
 
prerequisites
 
for
 
the
 
perception
 
of
 
impartial
 
evaluation
, 
and
 
can
 
reduce
 
the
 
defensive
 
reaction
. 
In
 
addition
, 
self-evaluation
 
shows
 
the
 
employee's
 
awareness
 
and
 
can
 be 
used
 
as
 a 
motivation
 
tool
.
8. 
Customers
. 
Customer
 
evaluation
 
is
 
usually
 
included
 
in
 
the
 360° 
feedback
 
method
. 
The
 
most
 
objective
 
evaluation
, 
when
 
there
 are 
several
 
evaluators
, 
then
 
biased
 
evaluation
 
is
 
avoided
. 
As
 a 
result
, 
the
 
scientific
 
literature
 
increasingly
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 360-degree 
feedback
, also 
known
 
as
 
multipartite
 
evaluation
, 
full-circle
 
evaluation
, 
or
 
group
 
evaluation
.

Formalized
 
and
 
informal
 
appraisal
 are 
two
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
employee
 
performance
 
appraisal
. 
Each
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
different
 
purposes
 
and
 
has
 
unique
 
advantages
 
and
 
disadvantages
.
Formalized
 
appraisal
 
refers
 to a 
structured
, 
systematic
 
process
 
of
 
evaluating
 
employee
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
criteria
, 
such
 
as
 
goals
, 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 (
KPIs
), 
or
 
competencies
. 
This
 
type
 
of
 
appraisal
 
usually
 
involves
 a 
formal
 
meeting
 
between
 
the
 
employee
 
and
 
their
 
supervisor
, 
during
 
which
 
the
 
supervisor
 
provides
 
feedback
, 
discusses
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
, 
and
 
sets
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
future
.
Features
 
of
 
formalized
 
assessment
:
Pre-established
 
evaluation
 
criteria
: 
Employees
 are 
evaluated
 
based
 
on
 
specific
, 
measurable
 
and
 
objective
 
criteria
 
agreed
 
in
 
advance
.
Documentation
: 
Formalized
 
appraisals
 
require
 
written
 
appraisal
 
documentation
 
that
 
can
 be 
used
 to 
track
 
employee
 
progress
, 
inform
 
management
 
decisions
, 
and
 serve 
as
 a 
reference
 
for
 
future
 
appraisals
.
Periodicity
: 
Formalized
 
evaluations
 are 
usually
 
conducted
 at 
regular
 
intervals
, 
such
 
as
 
annually
, 
semiannually
, 
or
 
quarterly
.
Consistency
: 
The
 
appraisal
 
process
 
is
 
consistent
 
across
 
the
 
organization
, 
ensuring
 
that
 
all
 
employees
 are 
appraised
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
criteria
 
and
 
methods
.
Formal
 
feedback
: 
Employees
 
receive
 
structured
 
feedback
 
during
 
the
 
appraisal
 
meeting
, 
which
 
provides
 
an
 
opportunity
 to 
discuss
 
performance
 
in
 
detail
 
and
 
set
 
future
 
expectations
.
Informal
 
assessment
 
is
 
more
 
flexible
 
and
 
spontaneous
. 
This
 
includes
 
continuous
, 
real-time
 
feedback
 
from
 
managers
, 
peers
 
or
 
other
 
stakeholders
, 
as
 
well
 
as
 
observations
 
of
 
employee
 
behavior
 
and
 
performance
.
Features
 
of
 
informal
 
assessment
:
Less
 
structured
: 
Informal
 
appraisals
 
do
 
not
 
follow
 a 
rigid
 
structure
 
or
 
set
 
of
 
criteria
, 
allowing
 
for
 
greater
 
flexibility
 
and
 
adaptability
 to 
individual
 
employee
 
needs
.
Continuous
 
feedback
: 
Employees
 
receive
 
feedback
 
and
 
support
 
continuously
, 
rather
 
than
 at 
set
 
intervals
. It 
helps
 
solve
 
performance
 
problems
 
in
 
real-time
 
and
 
drives
 
continuous
 
improvement
.
No
 
formal
 
documentation
: 
Informal
 
evaluations
 
generally
 
do
 
not
 
require
 
written
 
documentation
, 
which
 
can
 
reduce
 
administrative
 
burdens
 
and
 
allow
 
for
 
more
 
open
 
and
 
honest
 
feedback
.
Multiple
 
sources
 
of
 
evaluation
: 
Informal
 
evaluation
 
can
 
include
 
information
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
, 
such
 
as
 
peers
, 
subordinates
, 
or
 
even
 
customers
, 
providing
 a 
more
 
comprehensive
 
picture
 
of
 
employee
 
performance
.
Focus
 
on
 
Coaching
 
and
 
Development
: 
Informal
 
assessments
 
often
 
emphasize
 
opportunities
 
for
 
coaching
, 
mentoring
 
and
 
real-time
 
learning
 
rather
 
than
 
strict
 
assessment
 
and
 
judgment
.
Both
 
formalized
 
and
 
informal
 
evaluations
 
play
 
an
 
important
 role 
in
 
performance
 
management
. 
Formal
 
assessments
 
provide
 
structure
, 
consistency
 
and
 
documentation
, 
while
 
informal
 
assessments
 
offer
 
flexibility
, 
continuous
 
feedback
 
and
 a 
focus
 
on
 
coaching
 
and
 
development
. 
Organizations
 
should
 
consider
 
using
 a 
combination
 
of
 
both
 
types
 
of
 
appraisal
 to 
develop
 
an
 
effective
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
system
 
within
 
the
 
organization
.

Employee
 
performance
 
evaluation
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
management
 
that
 
helps
 
organizations
 
evaluate
 
employee
 
performance
, 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
feedback
, 
identify
 
opportunities
 
for
 
growth
 
and
 
development
, 
and
 
correctly
 
assign
 
rewards
 
for
 
work
 
performed
. 
The
 
performance
 
evaluation
 
process
 
can
 be 
divided
 
into
 
the
 
following
 
stages
:
Assessment
 
planning
In
 
this
 
initial
 
phase
, 
managers
 
and
 
employees
 
work
 
together
 to 
set
 
Clear
, 
Specific
, 
Measurable
, 
Attainable
, 
Relevant
, 
and
 Time-
bound
 (SMART) 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation
 
period
. 
These
 
goals
 
should
 be 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
organization's
 
overall
 
goals
 
and
 
strategies
. 
Appraisal
 
planning
 
may
 also 
include
 
selecting
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 (
KPIs
), 
identifying
 
required
 
competencies
, 
and
 
outlining
 
employee
 
behavioral
 
expectations
. 
This
 
stage
 
lays
 
the
 
foundation
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
appraisal
 
process
 
and
 
helps
 
ensure
 
that
 
both
 
managers
 
and
 
employees
 
have
 a 
clear
 
understanding
 
of
 
what
 
is
 
expected
.
Activity
 
monitoring
Performance
 
monitoring
 
involves
 
continuously
 
monitoring
 
an
 
employee's
 
progress
 
toward
 
their
 
goals
. 
Managers
 
provide
 
constant
 
feedback
, 
guidance
 
and
 
support
 to 
help
 
employees
 
stay
 
on
 
track
 
with
 
their
 
goals
 
and
 
resolve
 
any
 
issues
 
that
 
may
 
arise
. 
Performance
 
monitoring
 
may
 
include
 
periodic
 
check-ins
, 
progress
 
reports
, 
or
 
informal
 
discussions
 to 
evaluate
 
performance
, 
resolve
 
problems
, 
and
 
offer
 
encouragement
. 
This
 
stage
 
is
 
very
 
important
 to 
identify
 
potential
 
problems
 
early
 
and
 
make
 
the
 
necessary
 
changes
.
Assessment
Managers
 
gather
 
information
 
about
 
employee
 
performance
 
from
 
various
 
sources
, 
such
 
as
 
direct
 
observations
, 
self-assessments
, 
peer
 
assessments
, 
and
 
objective
 
performance
 
indicators
. A 
holistic
 
approach
 
allows
 
for
 a 
more
 
accurate
 
and
 
comprehensive
 
understanding
 
of
 
an
 
employee's
 
abilities
, 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
, 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
performance
, 
behavior
 
and
 
any
 
situational
 
constraints
 
that
 
may
 
have
 
affected
 
their
 
performance
.
Performance
 
appraisal
 
concludes
 
with
 a 
formal
 
process
 
of
 
assessment
 
and
 
documentation
 
against
 
pre-defined
 
objectives
, 
KPIs
 
or
 
competencies
. 
This
 
usually
 
involves
 a 
meeting
 
between
 
the
 
employee
 
and
 
their
 
manager
 
where
 
the
 
manager
 
provides
 
feedback
, 
discusses
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
 
and
 
sets
 
goals
 
for
 
the
 
future
. 
Performance
 
appraisal
 
is
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
decisions
 
regarding
 
promotions
, 
salary
 
adjustments
 
or
 
other
 
performance-related
 
rewards
. It also 
helps
 
identify
 
development
 
opportunities
 
and
 
provides
 a 
foundation
 
for
 
employee
 
growth
.
Awarding
 
of
 
remuneration
The
 
final
 
step
 
in
 
the
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
process
 
is
 to 
reward
 
employees
 
for
 
their
 
performance
. 
Rewards
 
can
 be 
financial
, 
such
 
as
 
bonuses
, 
raises
, 
or
 
stock
 
options
, 
or
 
nonfinancial
, 
such
 
as
 
public
 
recognition
, 
promotions
, 
or
 
professional
 
development
 
opportunities
. A 
well-structured
 
reward
 
system
 
can
 
increase
 
employee
 
motivation
, 
foster
 a 
culture
 
of
 
high
 
performance
, 
and
 
encourage
 
employees
 to 
strive
 
for
 
excellence
. 
By
 
linking
 
rewards
 to 
performance
, 
organizations
 
can
 
ensure
 
that
 
employee
 
contributions
 are 
recognized
 
and
 
valued
, 
thereby
 
promoting
 
employee
 
satisfaction
, 
engagement
 
and
 
retention
.
5
Organizations
 
conduct
 
performance
 
appraisals
 
for
 
the
 
following
 
important
 
reasons
:
Alignment
 
of
 
individual
 
and
 
organizational
 
goals
Performance
 
appraisals
 
help
 
align
 
employee
 
goals
 
with
 
broader
 
organizational
 
goals
 
and
 
strategies
. 
By
 
setting
 
clear
 
expectations
, 
organizations
 
can
 
ensure
 
that
 
employees
 
understand
 
their
 role 
in
 
contributing
 to 
the
 
company's
 
success
.
Identifying
 
employee
 
strengths
 
and
 
weaknesses
 
Performance
 
appraisals
 
provide
 
insight
 
into
 
employee
 
strengths
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
. 
By
 
understanding
 
the
 
skills
 
and
 
capabilities
 
of
 
their
 
employees
, 
managers
 
can
 
make
 
decisions
 
about
 
promotions
, 
task
 
allocation
, 
resource
 
allocation
, 
targeted
 
training
 
programs
, 
possible
 
layoffs
, 
and
 
new
 
hires
.
Encouraging
 
employee
 
development
 
Regular
 
evaluations
 
and
 
constructive
 
feedback
 
allow
 
employees
 to 
understand
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
work
, 
identify
 
gaps
, 
and
 
improve
. 
This
 
continuous
 
feedback
 
loop
 
fosters
 a 
culture
 
of
 
growth
, 
learning
, 
and
 
high
 
productivity
 
in
 
the
 
organization
. 
Performance
 
appraisals
 
help
 
identify
 
employee
 
development
 
needs
, 
career
 
aspirations
 
and
 
growth
 
potential
. 
Managers
 
can
 
use
 
this
 
information
 to 
create
 
personal
 
development
 
plans
, 
offer
 
coaching
 
or
 
mentoring
, 
and
 
provide
 
opportunities
 
for
 
skill
 
development
 
and
 
career
 
advancement
.
Increasing
 
employee
 
motivation
 
and
 
engagement
Performance
 
appraisals
 
can
 
increase
 
employee
 
motivation
 
by
 
setting
 
clear
 
expectations
, 
providing
 
feedback
 
and
 
recognizing
 
their
 
achievements
. 
When
 
employees
 
understand
 
how
 
their
 
actions
 
affect
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
organization
, 
they
 are 
more
 
likely
 to be 
engaged
 
and
 
committed
 to 
their
 
work
.
Improving
 
communication
 
between
 
managers
 
and
 
employees
 
The
 
appraisal
 
process
 
promotes
 
open
 
communication
 
between
 
employees
 
and
 
managers
, 
promoting
 a 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
expectations
, 
performance
 
standards
 
and
 
any
 
challenges
 
or
 
obstacles
 
that
 
may
 
affect
 
performance
. 
This
 
ongoing
 
dialogue
 
helps
 
build
 
trust
 
and
 
rapport
, 
ultimately
 
improving
 
employee-manager
 
relationships
.
Monitoring
 
progress
 
and
 
increasing
 
employee
 
accountability
Performance
 
appraisals
 
help
 
organizations
 
monitor
 
progress
 
toward
 
goals
 
and
 
hold
 
employees
 
accountable
 
for
 
their
 
performance
. 
This
 
process
 
allows
 
managers
 to 
identify
 
deviations
 
from
 
performance
 
standards
 
and
 take 
corrective
 
action
 
as
 
needed
.

Employee
 
performance
 
appraisal
 
or
 
job
 
evaluation
 
is
 
the
 
systematic
 
process
 
of
 
evaluating
 
an
 
employee's
 
performance
 
against
 
predetermined
 
goals
, 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 (
KPIs
), 
or

related
 to 
their
 role 
in
 
the

. 
The
 
main
 
purpose
 
of
 
performance
 
evaluation
 
is
 to 
identify
 
strengths
, 
employee
 
development
 
opportunities
, 
combining
 
individual
 
goals
 
with
 
organizational
 
goals
,

Performance
 
appraisals
 
help
 
management
 
set
 
performance
 
expectations
, 
realistic
 
goals
, 
and
 
efficiently
 
allocate
 
resources
. 
By
 
assessing
 
employees
' 
skills
, 
managers
 
can
 
identify
 
gaps
 
and
 
plan
 
training
 
and

programs
. 
Performance
 
evaluation
 
is
 
very
 
important
 
in
 
making
 
planning
 
decisions
 
in
 
the
 
field
 
of
 
human
 
resource
 
management
 
regarding
 
the
 
hiring
, 
promotion
 
or
 
firing
 
of

top
 
performers
, 
managers
 
can
 
drive
 
career
 
growth
, 
develop
 
succession
 
plans
,

Organiing
Employee
 
assessments
 
provide
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
capabilities
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
workforce
, 
enabling
 
managers
 to 
optimize
 
organizational
 
structure
. 
This
 
information
 
allows
 
managers
 to 
assign
