# Ok, but What is github then?

**Github.com** is a website that hosts *git* <u>repositories</u> on a remote server
- It also provides a GUI to easily *fork* or *clone* repositories to a local machine

# Version control

### But what is a <u>version control</u> system?

<br>

#### Version control system features

- Easily *keep track* of file versions
- *Rollback* to previous file versions
- Ability to have *unlimited* number of developers working on the same code base

> Also, losing work is *really* hard

`````col

===

- A central server repository (repo) holds the "official copy" of the code
	- The server maintains the *sole* version of the repo

- You make *checkouts* of it to your local copy
	- You make *local modifications*
	- Your changes are *not versioned*

- When you're done, you "*check in*" back to the server
	- Your checkin increments the repo's version

- You don't "checkout" from a central repo

	- Yours is "*just as good*" as theirs

- Many operations are local
	- Check in/out from *local* repo
	- Commit changes to *local* repo
	- Local repo keeps version history

- When you are ready, you can "*push*" changes back to the server

# Git areas

### Files can be:

- Checked out, *Modified*, but not yet committed (*working copy*)
- *Staged*, but not yet committed - Staged files are ready to be committed
- *Committed* - A commit saves a *snapshot* of all *staged* state

```mermaid

	participant Staging area;
	participant Git repo (.git);
	participant Remote repo;
	Git repo (.git)-)Working dir: Checkout the project

# Git workflow

- **Modify** files in your working directory
- **Stage** files, adding snapshots of them to your *staging* area
- **Commit**, which takes the files in the *staging* area and stores that snapshot permanently to your *Git* directory

# Initializing a repo

- $ Two common scenarios

`````col 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1.3
===

### To create a local Git repo in current directory

```bash
git init  # this will create a .git directory
git add . # add all files to the staging area
git commit -m "First commit OwO"
```

#### Adding a remote

```bash
git remote add "remote_name" "repo_url"
```

```` 
````col-md 
flexGrow=1
===

### To clone a remote repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux
```

This will create a new directory with the name of the repo and create a local copy of the files from the repo, along with all the commits

```` 
`````

---

# Staging files

- The first time we ask a file to be *tracked* by git, and *every time* before *commit*, we must add it to the *staging area*

# Committing

`````col

```bash
git status
```
![[Pasted image 20230402192409.png]]

# Viewing changes

`````col

# Viewing changes

- To see a log of all changes in your local repo

```bash
git log --oneline
```
![[Pasted image 20230402193057.png]]

---

# Interacting with the remote

- To *push* your local changes to the *remote* repo

```bash
git push
```

- If you want to *push* to a non-default *remote* repo

```bash
git push "remote_name" "branch_name"
```

![[Pasted image 20230402193527.png|100%]]

--- 

# Interacting with the remote

- To *pull* changes from the *remote* repo and put them into your working directory

```bash
git pull
```

- To *pull* changes from the *remote* repo *without putting* them them into your working directory

```bash
git fetch
```

# Merge conflicts

- When you *merge* branches or pull changes, **merge** conflicts can happen
- Lucky for you, *git* handles them gracefully
- After *pulling* / *merging*, git may complain about conflicts
![[Pasted image 20230402201348.png]]
- The conflicting files will contain *>>>* and *<<<* sections to indicate where git was unable to resolve a conflict
![[Pasted image 20230402201627.png]]
- You can resolve the conflict manually or through any *GUI*
