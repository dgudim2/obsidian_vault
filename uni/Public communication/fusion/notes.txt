# Nuclear fusion / slide 0

Today I am going talk about the energy sector, specifically, about nuclear fusion


# Slide 1

I doubt that every one of you know what nuclear fusion is though.
Some of you may think it's some kind of technology from the future of from sci-fi films.
But no! It's a technology being developed right now as we speak.

Then it must be very new, right?
No! If we look at the development timeline, we see that the development has started in 1958, in USSR
and in that year we got our first prototype.

Ok, then why are we not using it today?
ah, that's a good question, I'll talk about it in a bit.


# Slide 2

But first let me explain about an adjacent technology that we ARE using nowadays
The technology is nuclear fission, not fusion
And the idea is very simple
Step 1: Take angry green rocks (Usually uranium)
Step 2: Put them together
They get even more angry and heat up
We collect that heat and use it to heat up the water
Then we can spin the turbine with the produced steam (or if you are a nuclear scientist, make some tea with the hot water)
This is the technology that is used in all commercial nuclear reactors
And nowadays the reactors are very safe

# Slide 3

Ok, back to fusion
How does it differ from fission?
Well, instead of taking uranium, we take deuterium and tritium
They are both isotopes oh hydrogen
These are the smallest atoms, therefore the easiest to put close together.
And oh boy we need to put them close together, not just at any distance,
we need to put them so close, that the atoms themselves start to merge,
and when they merge, they release a neutrino, helium and also, some mass is lost.
Where does the mass go? Into heat energy! And that's what we are after.
We collect that heat energy and again, spin a turbine or make some tea.

# Slide 4

Now, I want to talk about a project called "ITER"
The project is to build a huge fusion reactor.
But the reactor won't produce any energy, it's only for research purposes.
Nice research I might say...
The project was started in 2007 and is funded by multiple governments
It is 4.2km2 in area and weights 23000 tonnes
The total invested money so far is 22B$


# Slide 5

This is the reactor type which they are using, it's called a tokamak
and is a doughnut-shaped thing
It uses really strong electro-magnets to confine the plasma and spin it around
The plasma is heated to about 25x the suns temperature


# Slide 6

This is how it looks
(This is a real video)


# Slide 7

Ok, now let's talk about positives and negatives
For the positives, we have a few things
The energy gains in theory can be up to 1Million times as much as from fossil fuels
When the technology is developed enough it should be cheap and green
That's about it for the pluses really

But if we look at the minuses we start to see why we don't use the tech today
First of all: to sustain fusion, the plasma needs to be SUPER hot, literally hotter than the surface of the sun
The tech is still in early stages, so one needs large investment to prototype anything
The fusion reaction are really fast and violent in their nature, so it's hard to capture them efficiently
Not to mention that you need to start the reaction somehow in the first place
Then you need to keep the plasma steady by constantly changing the magnetic fields
Then there is the problem of fuel
Deuterium can be easily extracted from water, but tritium is much more rare
only a bit in the upper atmosphere and a byproduct of regular nuclear reactors


# Slide 8

But what about startups? Everything starts with startups, right?
Yes, there are a lot of private companies who want to develop small reactor and output the energy to the grid.
And actually many of them are sponsored by millionaires such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos
Majority of people in the business think that fusion is close to being commercial relevant
and that the plants will be able to deliver energy somewhere in 2035

# Slide 9

4.8B $ have been invested into startups up to 2022, 2.8B $ arrived in the 2022 alone (> 50%)
These numbers pale in comparison to ITER, but have a different purpose.
While ITER lays the scientific groundwork, those startups want to produce the energy already

# Conclusion

None of the startups have produces net power, they are not even close
In my opinion we should not stupid as Germany and focus more on regular nuclear reactors for now,
because even though the fusion technology is very promising, it's still far from being ready,
but the world is already in dire need of clean energy.
