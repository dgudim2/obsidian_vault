--- How do You understand web application in the context of web application testing? 

An application that we use via a web browser, it has several components
1. Frontend (html, ja, css) that we can test manually or with automated ui tests
2. Backend that we can test using unit tests and integration tests 
The backend runs separately from the frontend and frontend communicates with it using rest/soap/rpc





--- What needs to be tested for a web application? 

Frontend: Ui/Ux performance, input data validation tests
Cookies testing, bypass testing

Server side: server response testing, database testing





--- What is a test case in web application testing? 

Test case is a task which describes how to test and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements.






--- May we use control flow graphs for web application testing?

Yes. Control flow graphs provide a visual representation of the control flow within a program or application. In the case of web applications, a control flow graph can help testers understand the flow of control between different components, pages, and modules within the application.





--- Web application testing at client side;

Classical unit testing
Check that the system directs (or forwards) to valid pages
Input data validation testing
Events handler (listener), should react to corresponding user actions. 
Cookies testing 




--- Web application testing at server side;

Functionality, security, performace, databases
If server-side source code is available we can use graph model to test the server.





--- Multiple conditions testing and Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) Testing. What is the purpose? Describe the techniques.


The purpose of multiple conditions testing is to verify the behavior of a software system when it encounters various combinations of conditions or inputs. 
MC/DC testing is to assess the reliability and correctness of software systems.

In multiple conditions testing, testers identify different combinations of conditions that can influence the behavior of a software system, including both valid and invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and error scenarios. 

MC/DC testing is a white-box testing technique that aims to achieve thorough coverage of decision conditions within the software code. 
Techniques for generating MC/DC test cases typically involve analyzing the control flow of the software code to identify decision conditions and their outcomes.





--- Basis path testing; cyclomatic complexity, what are the three ways to compute it? Myerâ€˜s interval;


Bases path testing method analyzes the control flow graph of a program to find a set of linearly independent paths of execution .
Cyclomatic complexity - number of tests to test all control statements (= number of conditions +1)

Methods:
- Edges and nodes
- Predicate method
- Topological method

Myer's interval helps identify independent paths in the control flow graph, ensuring thorough testing of all possible execution paths.
