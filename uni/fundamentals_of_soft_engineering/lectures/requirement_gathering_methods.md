# Requirement gathering methods

## 2nd method: observation

### What should be do when we apply observation method?

- Observe what existing systems our target client/audience is using, what features are they using, what features do they want, what problems are they facing, identify potential areas for improvement.
- Observe how people perform their tasks, interact with systems.

- Maybe compare different competing software solutions.

### When observation method is suitable and when not suitable?

I would say it is almost always suitable unless we are building a system that has never been implemented before / our client is asking for something bespoke or have not used or considered a similar system before. But even then we can give our client a very rough prototype and observe how they use it/ what features they want.

> Example: Me are developing mano vgtu app (from scratch, there is no app). One option would be to observe which parts of the mano website the students are using the most. Another option would be to observe how students of other universities are using their apps, but in this case, this would be more of an interview rather than an observation.

### What are results of observation (format, content)?

- Table comparing the features of existing solutions
- Price of the solution / comparison
- Good / bad strategies / implementations
- Time to MVP, time to complete implementation
- (Optional) Better strategy or a better solution

### Where is difficulties or issues, when we apply observation method?

- Copy bad stuff / shortcomings from exiting systems
- Exiting patents (only applicable to physical products (like a car part))
- Misunderstand the drawback / the difficulties the client encounters
